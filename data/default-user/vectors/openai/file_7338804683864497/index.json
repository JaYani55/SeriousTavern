Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! sie sich, wenn die Millionen in den Management-Etagen fließen. Der Neid blüht. Doch in der eigenen Situation helfen, das kann er natürlich nicht, sondern führt vielmehr zu Vorurteilen, von denen manche stimmen, andere aber (schon lange) nicht mehr. Dabei ist es entscheidend, gut informiert zu sein, will man an der eigenen Situation etwas ändern: Wo steht man mit seinem Ge- halt im Berufsvergleich? Ist es überhaupt realistisch, eigene Ge- haltsvorstellungen erfolgreich durchsetzen zu können? Wo lässt sich heute gut verdienen? Was kann man selbst beeinflussen und wie ist der allgemeine Trend? Geht es vielleicht nicht nur einem selbst so, dass die Gehaltserwartungen nicht erfüllt werden? Gibt es Auswege, Alternativen wie den Start in die Selbstständigkeit – und würde das wirklich etwas bringen? Wo kann man etwas für sich herausholen, und wo muss man aufpassen? Das erste Kapitel soll daher zunächst eine realistische Einschät- zung ermöglichen: Wie ist das Gehaltsgefüge in Deutschland? Wie entwickeln sich die Gehälter? Wie geht es Arbeitnehmern, Selbst- ständigen, Beamten? Es wird gezeigt, wie es um gängige Vorstel- lungen steht, ob sie noch mit der Wirklichkeit mithalten können: Dafür werden zehn Gehältermythen aufgegriffen und erklärt, was an ihnen wahr ist. Was ist zum Beispiel mit der Annahme, dass Akademiker mehr verdienen? Lohnt sich ein Studium wirklich, und was lässt sich in den einzelnen Berufen tatsächlich verdienen? Aktuelle Befragungen von Hochschulabsolventen geben dazu auf- schlussreiche Erkenntnisse. Für Diskussionen sorgen auch immer wieder die Einkommen der Frauen. Gleich vorweg sei verraten: Dass sie alle um 30 Pro- zent weniger als Männer verdienen, stimmt so nicht. Mitunter tragen sie auch eine Mitschuld, wenn der Kollege beim Gehalt an ihnen vorbeizieht.

9 Ein weiteres spannendes und sehr aktuelles Thema ist die Leis- tungsbezahlung. Immer mehr Firmen führen Prämien ein, die es für individuelles Engagement gibt – häufig auf Kosten bislang fes- ter Gehaltsbestandteile wie etwa das Weihnachtsgeld. Die Arbeit- geber versprechen sich davon mehr Motivation ihrer Belegschaft, und der Einzelne kann auf satte Extrazahlungen hoffen, wenn er seinen Chef mit seiner Leistung überzeugt. Aber ziehen die Mit- arbeiter dabei womöglich den Kürzeren, oder profitieren Arbeit- geber und Arbeitnehmer gleichermaßen von solchen Regelungen? Und worauf muss man achten, wenn man Leistungsbezahlungen vereinbart? Auch Manager werden nach Leistung bezahlt, allerdings geht es bei ihnen nicht um ein paar Tausend Euro mehr oder weniger im Jahr. 2,8 Millionen Euro verdienen Vorstandsmitglieder eines Dax-Unternehmens heute im Schnitt – und ihre Bezüge legen jährlich zu. Die Folge: Die Schere zwischen den Einkommen von Unternehmenslenkern und Arbeitnehmern geht mehr und mehr auseinander. Der Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann erhält inzwischen allein so viel Geld wie 310 Privatkundenberater zu- sammen. Die Manager haben ihrer Belegschaft aber nicht nur ein paar Nullen auf dem Gehaltszettel voraus, sondern ihre Ein- kommen steigen, während der Durchschnittsarbeitnehmer seit Jahren mit weniger auskommen muss. Selbst wenn er brutto mehr verdient, bleibt netto weniger übrig, denn hohe Abgaben und stei- gende Preise fressen seine Gehaltssteigerungen auf. Wirtschafts- forscher beklagen die Auswirkungen dieser Entwicklung auf die Gesellschaft: Die Einkommensungleichheit zwischen ganz oben und ganz unten nimmt zu, die Mittelschicht schrumpft. Die Ab- stiegsängste vieler Bürger, wie sie regelmäßig in Umfragen zutage treten, scheinen also berechtigt. Ob die von der Politik geplante Mitarbeiterbeteiligung daran etwas ändern kann? Kaum.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Seite, unvorstellbarer Reichtum auf der anderen: Millionen Men- schen in Deutschland gelten als reich – genau: 6,8 Millionen. Die höchsten Reichtumsquoten gibt es unter Beamten und Selbst- ständigen – sollte das Anlass zu Neid auf diese beiden Einkom- mensgruppen sein? Nur bedingt: Es gibt viele Selbstständige, die am Rand des Existenzminimums leben und kaum genug für ihre soziale Absicherung verdienen. Nach einem Berufsleben mit ge- ringem Einkommen droht ihnen auch noch die Altersarmut. Und die Beamten – auch sie mussten in den vergangenen Jahren einiges einstecken. »Hauptsache, verbeamtet« – das gilt nicht mehr. Wuss- ten Sie beispielsweise, dass alle Beamten zusammengenommen im Durchschnitt mehr als der »normale« Arbeitnehmer arbeiten? Das alles zeigt: Es ist endlich an der Zeit, über Gehälter zu sprechen und die Karten auf den Tisch zu legen – zu viel Halbwis- sen herrscht vor. Aber darf man überhaupt über seinen Verdienst reden? Ist die Diskretion nicht eher berechtigt? Schließlich enthal- ten viele Arbeitsverträge sogar eine Verschwiegenheitsklausel. Doch wenn man schon nicht darüber reden darf (oder mag), wenigsten träumen ist erlaubt: vom eigenen Weg zur ersten Mil- lion. Eliteforscher wissen zwar, dass es nur wenige aus eigener Kraft ganz nach oben schaffen, aber immerhin, es gibt Ausnah- men wie die schönen Top-Models, die Millionen verdienen. Die Deutsche Heidi Klum gehört mit 8 Millionen US-Dollar im Jahr zu den Top-Ten-Verdienerinnen. Dann die Fußballstars, die es gleich auf zweistellige Millioneneinnahmen bringen. Und, tat- sächlich, einige Aufsteiger in bodenständigen Berufen schaffen es auch zu Reichtum. So richtig lohnen kann sich zum Beispiel eine Karriere in der Finanzbranche. Und damit sind wir beim nächsten großen Kapitel: den Gehäl- terfallen, die sich viele selbst bauen.

11 die sich nichtsdestotrotz viele junge Menschen entscheiden. Dazu zählen viele Berufe im Dienstleistungsbereich. In einigen bewegen sich die Beschäftigten sogar trotz Ausbildung im Niedriglohnbe- reich, das heißt sie verdienen dauerhaft weniger als zwei Drittel des Durchschnittseinkommens. Selbst ein Studium schützt nicht vor einem schlechten Gehalt. Ob sich ein Hochschulabschluss finanziell auszahlt, liegt stark an der Fächerwahl, wie auch die lange Diskussion über die Generation Praktikum gezeigt hat. Manchen stört das nicht, er hat seine Laufbahn aus Idealismus gewählt. Das trifft besonders auf die Künstler zu, die häufig nur dank Nebenjobs über die Runden kommen. Andere fühlen sich ungerecht behandelt. Sie sind durch die Berufswahl, einen Zeitar- beitsjob, der zum Dauerzustand wird, oder durch die Gründung einer Familie mit anschließender Auszeit in die Gehälterfalle ge- rutscht und wissen nicht, wie sie aus dieser wieder herauskommen können. Zum Glück gibt es für die meisten einen Ausweg – und manch- mal macht es auch Sinn, die eigene Einstellung zu hinterfragen. Was nützt es einer Erzieherin, ihr Gehalt am Verdienst eines Unternehmensberaters zu messen? Oder einem IT-Freiberufler in Halle, von Honoraren in Frankfurt am Main zu träumen?

Ihr Gehaltsschicksal in die eigene Hand nehmen wollen alle, die eine Gehaltsverhandlung vor sich haben. Leider werden dabei immer wieder dieselben Fehler begangen: Während die einen aus Scheu zu wenig wagen, stolpern die anderen unüberlegt und mit unrealistischen Vorstellungen in ein Personalgespräch hinein. Ka- pitel 3 erklärt die typischen Fehler bei Gehaltsverhandlungen und zeigt, worauf es bei diesen wirklich ankommt.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! kommen um eine besonders gute Vorbereitung nicht herum, auch wenn die Bedeutung des ersten Gehalts in der Regel überschätzt wird. Welche Auswirkungen das Gehalt auf unser Leben und Arbei- ten hat, weckt das Interesse von Soziologen, Psychologen und Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern. Macht ein höheres Gehalt glück- lich? Was bringt die Bezahlung nach Leistung – und was richtet sie an? Verdienen große Menschen mehr als kleinere? Diese und andere, bisweilen skurril anmutende Fragen sind Gegenstand wis- senschaftlicher Untersuchungen. Was die Wissenschaft über Gehälter herausfindet, mag manch- mal unglaublich klingen, aber es zeigt auch: Wissen über das Thema Gehalt gibt es mehr als genug.

Tatsächlich besitzen manche Vorurteile einen Wahrheitsgehalt, aber manches stellt sich in der Wirklichkeit doch ganz anders dar, als von den meisten gedacht. Das folgende Kapitel greift zehn häufige Annahmen zum Thema Gehalt auf und erklärt, was dahintersteckt, was daran richtig ist und was nicht.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Arbeitsmarktexperten betonen unermüdlich, dass sich ein Stu- dium lohnt. Denn die Gefahr, arbeitslos, gar langzeitarbeitslos zu werden, liegt für Studierte im Vergleich zu Beschäftigten mit nichtakademischer Ausbildung deutlich unter dem Durchschnitt. Doch ob sich ein Studium auch finanziell lohnt, ist eine andere Frage – und die wird mancher Akademiker mit einem Nein be- antworten müssen. Umworben werden in erster Linie diejenigen Akademiker mit dem »richtigen« Studiengang, das heißt der gerade auf dem Arbeitsmarkt gefragte, momentan also vor allem Ingenieure und Informatiker. Sie steigen zu deutlich überdurchschnittlichen Be- dingungen ein: mit einem unbefristeten Vollzeitjob und einem vergleichsweise hohen Gehalt. In den vergangenen Jahren ist jedoch generell die Beschäfti- gungsunsicherheit für junge Akademiker deutlich gewachsen; auf einer befristeten Stelle zu starten ist üblich. Auch Beschäftigung auf Honorarbasis hat zugenommen. Beides trifft vor allem Ab- solventen von Magisterstudiengängen wie Sprach- und Kultur- wissenschaftler, aber auch bei den Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern startet nur noch jeder zweite mit einem unbefristeten Vollzeitjob ins Berufsleben, wie die jüngste Absolventenbefragung der Hoch- schul-Informations-System GmbH (HIS) zeigt. Die HIS führt seit 1989 Absolventenbefragungen durch, zuletzt bei Akademikern, die 2005 ihr Studium abgeschlossen haben. Nicht alle Absolventen ergattern einen Job, der ihrer Qualifika- tion entspricht. Während Elektro- und Maschinenbauingenieure überdurchschnittlich häufig eine passende Stelle finden, werden Wirtschaftswissenschaftler häufig unter ihrem Niveau eingestellt. Bei den Absolventen von Magisterstudiengängen fühlt sich sogar nur ein Drittel beim Berufseinstieg adäquat beschäftigt.

Das wirkt sich natürlich auch auf ihre Arbeitszufrie- denheit aus – und die kommt in den bisherigen ökonomischen Modellen, die danach fragen, ob sich ein Studium lohnt, nicht vor. Darauf weist Kolja Briedis von der HIS hin. Und auch wenn Akademiker zunächst zeitlich befristet beschäftigt sind, kommt es im Berufsverlauf zu einer deutlichen Stabilisierung. Häufig können sie in dem Unternehmen, in dem sie angefangen haben, Fuß fassen. Zur Frage nach der Position der Absolventen erläutert Kolja Briedis: »Die meisten arbeiten als wissenschaftliche Angestellte ohne Leitungsfunktion. Üblich ist es auch, als qualifizierter An- gestellter, also zum Beispiel in gehobener Sachbearbeiterfunktion, zu arbeiten. In den vergangenen Jahren haben sich die Qualifi- kationsanforderungen deutlich verändert. Viele Stellen werden heute mit Akademikern besetzt, die früher Absolventen von Berufsausbildungen übernehmen konnten. Das liegt daran, dass die Aufgaben anspruchsvoller geworden sind, zum Beispiel mehr Eigenverantwortung verlangt wird.« Beschäftigung unter Niveau ist für die meisten ein Übergangs- phänomen für die erste Zeit nach dem Studium. Doch für einen Teil der Akademiker bleibt die Lage problematisch, stellte die HIS-Absolventenbefragung fest: Betroffen sind vor allem Ma- gisterabsolventen, da sie einen sehr unspezifischen Arbeitsmarkt haben, beispielsweise gibt es kaum eine Stellenausschreibung, in der explizit nach einem Kulturwissenschaftler gefragt wird, und viele Absolventen müssen erst sehr mühevoll deutlich machen, was sie können. Schon bei ihrem Studienwahlverhalten zeigen Geisteswissenschaftler, dass sie weniger stark auf die Möglichkeit des beruflichen Erfolgs achten und ein gutes Einkommen ihnen weniger wichtig ist als zum Beispiel angehenden Ingenieuren.

then 19 jahrgang 2005 erstmals gesunken sind. Im direkten Vergleich profitierte der zuvor untersuchte Absolventenjahrgang von 2001 von einer sehr guten konjunkturellen Lage und konnte damals sehr gut ins Berufsleben starten. Zudem wirkt sich bei Akade- mikern eine konjunkturelle Eintrübung vor allem darauf aus, zu welchen Bedingungen sie einen Job bekommen, weniger stark auf die Arbeitslosenquote. »Eine schlechtere Arbeitsmarktlage schlägt zum Beispiel auf die Gehälter durch. Dazu kommt die Umstellung beim Tarifvertrag des öffentlichen Dienstes, hier steigen Absolventen jetzt häufig mit 300 bis 400 Euro weniger monatlich ein«, so Briedis. Beruhigen kann Kolja Briedis allerdings Hochschulabsolventen, die mit nun gesunkenen Einstiegsgehältern angefangen haben – ihr Einkommen wird nicht auf Dauer mager bleiben: »Die Ent- wicklung der Gehälter steigt bei Akademikern im Berufsverlauf an. Bei vielen gehen sie schon in den ersten Jahren deutlich nach oben.« Akademikergehälter im Vergleich mit Gehältern anderer Ausbildungen Wissenschaftler sprechen von der »Bildungsrendite«, wenn sie be- rechnen, ob es sich für den Einzelnen finanziell lohnt, in einen höheren Bildungsabschluss zu investieren. Die Bildungsrendite zeigt, wie viel mehr Einkommen durch ein zusätzliches Jahr Bil- dung erreicht werden kann. Im Jahr 2005 lag sie in Westdeutsch- land bei 7,5 Prozent, in Ostdeutschland bei 7,7 Prozent. Bildung zahlt sich also tatsächlich aus.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! zent mehr als Beschäftigte ohne Berufsausbildung, Fachkräfte mit abgeschlossener Berufsausbildung 20 Prozent mehr. Nicht jeder Hochschulabsolvent erreicht die hier genannten Durchschnittsbezüge. Ob sich ein Studium für den Einzelnen – verglichen mit kürzeren Ausbildungswegen – finanziell wirklich auszahlt, hängt von der Studienrichtung, dem eingeschlagenen Berufsweg und dem Karriereverlauf ab, und die Verdienstunter- schiede zwischen Hochschulabsolventen sind teilweise gewaltig. Die höchsten Renditen – so eine Studie des Forschungsinstituts für Bildungs- und Sozialökonomie – gibt es in den Fächern Medizin, Jura sowie Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften. Was Berufseinsteiger mit Hochschulabschluss verdienen Den Einstiegsgehältern der Absolventen von Universitäten und Fachhochschulen widmen sich nicht nur die HIS-Studien. Es gibt alljährlich verschiedene Erhebungen, die in der Regel auf Angaben der Arbeitgeber fußen und die Einkommenssituation in einzelnen Berufen noch detaillierter darstellen. Da die Ge- hälter mal nach Fachrichtungen, mal nach Branchen oder Posi- tionen in den Blick genommen werden, unterscheiden sich meist auch die jeweiligen Ergebnisse, wie die folgenden Beispiele zei- gen: Beispiel 1 An der Studie der Personalberatung alma mater haben im Jahr 2008 bundesweit 864 Unternehmen unterschied- licher Größe und verschiedener Branchen teilgenommen, die insgesamt 1 946 Gehaltsangaben gemacht haben (Jahresgesamt- gehälter inklusive Urlaubsgeld und Prämien).

then 21 (Forschung und Entwicklung). Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr sind die Gehälter leicht gestiegen. Die Firmengröße spielt bei der Bezahlung eine entscheidende Rolle: Wer in kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen mit weniger als 1 000 Beschäftigten einsteigt, wird unterdurchschnitt- lich bezahlt: In einem Großunternehmen lässt sich bis zu 8,9 Pro- zent mehr Gehalt verdienen. Dennoch sind der Studie zufolge auch kleinere Unternehmen bereit, überdurchschnittliche Gehälter zu zahlen, falls sie eine Stelle dringend besetzen müssen und der Bewerber exakt passt, im Einzelfall mehr als 50 000 Euro im Jahr.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! besten hingegen Banken, Chemieunternehmen und der Fahr- zeugbau. Auch der Hochschulabschluss wirkt sich aufs Gehalt aus (Ge- haltsabschlag von 10 bis 20 Prozent bei Bachelor-Absolventen). Beispiel 2: Auch die Gewerkschaft IG Metall erhebt jährlich die Einstiegsgehälter von Hochschulabsolventen. Allerdings be- schränkt sie sich dabei auf die Fachrichtungen Betriebswirtschaft, Ingenieur- und Naturwissenschaften sowie Informatik. Im Jahr 2008 wurden 94 Unternehmen befragt aus den Bereichen Auto- mobil, Elektro, Informationstechnologie, Maschinenbau, Stahl und Telekommunikation, von denen die meisten tarifgebunden sind. 3 000 Einstiegsgehälter wurden so ermittelt.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! dienen im Schnitt knapp 40 000 Euro im Jahr, wenn sie einen Universitätsabschluss haben. Mit Fachhochschulabschluss gibt es 37 200 Euro, mit Promotion sogar 48 317 Euro. Das zeigt die On- line-Gehaltsumfrage von ingenieurkarriere.de, bei der von 2002 bis 2007 73 000 Ingenieure ihre Gehaltsdaten eingegeben haben. Die höchsten Gehälter erzielen Absolventen der Fächer Elektro- technik, Maschinenbau, Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen und Informa- tik. Das Schlusslicht bilden die Bauingenieure mit 30 890 Euro. Die Größe des Arbeitgebers spielt bei den Einstiegsgehältern eine entscheidende Rolle: In Unternehmen mit bis zu 50 Mitarbei- tern gibt es im ersten Job 8 000 Euro weniger im Jahr. Im ersten Job arbeiten die meisten nach Tarifvertrag. Doch in den ersten Berufsjahren machen Ingenieure ihre größten Gehalts- sprünge und werden dann außertariflich bezahlt: Schon nach Tabelle 5: Einstiegsgehälter von Ingenieuren nach Studienfächern Branche Gehälterspanne Median Chemie 58 492 – 77 113 66 070 Fahrzeugbau 53 360 – 75 800 65 000 Energieversorger 52 950 – 80 083 64 815 Elektronik 50 420 – 73 868 62 427 IT 50 660 – 75 195 61 383 Maschinenbau 50 975 – 69 807 59 943 Baugewerbe 42 400 – 59 760 49 620 Ingenieurbüro 41 167 – 57 494 48 664 Erläuterung: Die mittlere Spalte zeigt die Spannbreite der erhobenen Gehälter, die rechte Spalte den Median – die eine Hälfte der erhobenen Gehälter liegt darunter, die andere darüber.

Wie die Umfrage von ingenieurkarriere.de zeigt, ver- dienen Ingenieure als Projektmanager bis zu 66 000 Euro in der Chemie- und Pharmaindustrie, die neben dem Fahrzeug- und Ma- schinenbau zu den bestzahlenden Branchen gehört. Am wenigsten gibt es im Baugewerbe und in Ingenieur- und Planungsbüros, wo die Gehälter seit dem Jahr 2004 deutlich ins Hintertreffen geraten sind und um mehr als 20 Prozent unter den Gehältern anderer Ingenieure liegen. Im Jahr 2007 zeigten jedoch auch die Einstiegs- gehälter in diesem Bereich erstmals nach oben.

then 27 Gehälter gesteigert. Der Anteil der variablen, das heißt vom per- sönlichen und unternehmerischen Erfolg abhängigen Vergütung am Gesamtgehalt, gewinnt zunehmend an Bedeutung.

Die Gewerkschaft hat Ende 2007 19 427 Gehaltsdaten aus 26 Betrieben erhoben, darunter Software-Anbieter, IT-Beratungsunternehmen und Call- center verschiedener Unternehmensgrößen. Demnach gab es trotz der guten Geschäftsentwicklung in der Branche in einigen Posi- tionen sogar Gehaltsabschläge, beispielsweise in den Bereichen Tabelle 7: Das verdienen IT-Experten Position

then 29 Was Ärzte verdienen Der drohende Ärztemangel und die Abwanderung junger Me- diziner ins Ausland haben die Verdienstsituation dieser Berufs- gruppe zum Gegenstand öffentlicher Diskussionen gemacht. Obwohl Ärzte verglichen mit vielen anderen Berufsgruppen gut verdienen, ernten sie meist Verständnis, wenn sie für ihre langen Bereitschaftszeiten und ihre hohe Verantwortung für Menschen- leben mehr Gehalt fordern, und sie genießen im Berufsvergleich das höchste Ansehen. Die Gehälter für Ärzte in kommunalen Krankenhäusern sehen nach dem Tarifvertrag der Ärztevereinigung Marburger Bund fol- gendermaßen aus: Ärzte erhalten im ersten Berufsjahr 3 662 Euro monatlich brutto, ab dem sechsten Berufsjahr 4 582 Euro. Fach- ärzte steigen mit 4 834 Euro brutto monatlich ein und können nach entsprechender Berufserfahrung auf bis zu 6 005 Euro kommen. Oberärzte erhalten zwischen 6 055 und 6 410 Euro. Außerdem gibt es Zulagen für Sonn-, Feiertags- und Bereitschaftsdienste. Die reguläre Wochenarbeitszeit ist mit 40 Stunden festgelegt, wobei sie mit Bereitschaftsdiensten auf bis 60 Stunden steigen kann.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Die Einkommen niedergelassener Ärzte schwanken stark nach Fachgebieten und Region. Das durchschnittliche jährliche Ein- kommen an Honoraren liegt nach Auswertungen der Kassenärzt- lichen Bundesvereinigung (KBV) bei 191 400 Euro. Von diesem Bruttoeinkommen gehen noch die Kosten für die Praxis und die Mitarbeiter, für soziale Absicherung und Steuern ab. Zwei Drit- tel der Ärzte verdienen jedoch weniger als dieses Durchschnitts- gehalt. Nach Fachrichtung betrachtet erhalten Radiologen die höchsten Honorare, gefolgt von Internisten und Augenärzten. Laut KBV sind die Honorareinnahmen der Ärzte seit den neun- ziger Jahren gesunken – auch verglichen mit den Einkommen der Angestellten. Was Lehrer verdienen Beim Verdienst ist Lehrer nicht gleich Lehrer. Die Höhe ihres Ge- halts hängt davon ab, an welcher Schulform sie unterrichten, ob sie im Angestellten- oder im Beamtenverhältnis arbeiten und in welchem Bundesland ihre Schule liegt. Die meisten Lehrer sind als Beamte im Dienst der Länder be- schäftigt. Sie werden nach Besoldungsgruppen bezahlt, die meh- rere Gehaltsstufen haben, die nach Alter, Berufserfahrung und Leistung erreicht werden. Die Eingruppierung kann sich je nach Bundesland unterscheiden. Seit der Föderalismusreform im Jahr 2006 können die Bundesländer die Besoldung ihrer Beamten selbst regeln. Das führt zu bundesweiten Verdienstunterschieden. Solange es keine länderspezifischen Regeln gibt, wird weiter nach dem Bundesbesoldungsgesetz bezahlt, aus der auch die folgenden Beispiele stammen.

then 31 grundgehalt liegt bei 2 766 Euro monatlich, das höchste Gehalt in dieser Gruppe bei 3 786 Euro. Lehrer an Sonderschulen, Realschu- len und Gymnasien sind in der Besoldungsgruppe A13 eingeord- net (Einstiegsgrundgehalt: 3 106 Euro, Höchstgehalt: 4 208 Euro). Dazu werden monatliche Familienzuschläge ab etwa 110 Euro aufwärts gezahlt, deren Höhe von der Anzahl der Kinder und der Besoldungsstufe abhängt. Außerdem können Leistungszulagen ge- zahlt werden. Neben dem monatlichen Grundgehalt gibt es noch Weihnachts- und Urlaubsgeld, das in den vergangenen Jahren aber eingeschränkt wurde und von Bundesland zu Bundesland unterschiedlich gezahlt wird. Die Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten für Lehrer sind begrenzt. Schul- leiter an Grund- und Hauptschulen werden nach A13 und A14 bezahlt, an Realschulen bis A15. Die höchste Gehaltsstufe in der Besoldungsgruppe A14 entspricht 4 660 Euro. Bei A15 sind es 5 262 Euro. Lehrer an Gymnasien werden nach mehreren Berufs- jahren in der Regel zum Oberstudienrat befördert und erhalten dann Bezüge nach A14. Die weitere Beförderung zum Studien- direktor mit Besoldungsgruppe A15 ist mit der Übernahme be- sonderer Aufgaben verbunden. Schulleiter an Gymnasien werden nach A16 bezahlt (bis zu 5 861 Euro). Nicht verbeamtete Lehrer werden nach dem Tarifvertrag der Länder bezahlt. Das betrifft etwa 300 000 von insgesamt 800 000 Lehrern. Vor allem in Ostdeutschland arbeiten viele Lehrer im Angestelltenverhältnis. Am Gymnasium sind sie in der Entgelt- gruppe 13 eingeordnet; das Gehalt startet bei 2 817 Euro, in der höchsten Stufe können 4 100 Euro erreicht werden.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! schen jedoch wieder entspannt. Dennoch finden viele Berufsein- steiger noch immer nur auf Honorarbasis eine Anstellung. Laut BA zahlen kleinere Kanzleien Honorare von 15 Euro die Stunde und Jahresgehälter von 20 000 Euro. Junge Rechtsanwälte, die sich notgedrungen selbstständig machen, müssen nicht selten ihre Zulassung wegen ausbleibenden Erfolgs wieder zurückgeben. Eine Umfrage des Deutschen Anwaltvereins unter 300 Kanz- leien Ende 2007 zeigt, wie gut Juristen mit Prädikatsexamen ver- dienen können (www.anwaltsblatt-karriere.de): Die Einstiegsge- hälter bei internationalen Großsozietäten liegen zwischen 75 000 und 100 000 Euro, doch spielen in dieser Liga deutschlandweit nicht einmal 3 000 Anwälte mit. Die Einstiegsgehälter aller Juristen schwanken nach Rechtsge- bieten und Regionen. Im Arbeitsrecht liegen sie zwischen 34 000 und 90 000 Euro.

Im Verkehrsrecht verdient man zwischen 24 000 bis 50 000 Euro. Im Familienrecht zahlen die Kanzleien sehr unterschiedlich.

Nach bestandener Ausbildung können sie sich auf freie Notarstellen bei den Justizministerien bewerben.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! 40 000 Euro im Jahr verdienen, wie eine Entgeltstudie der Ge- werkschaft IG Metall zeigt. Doch viele Geistes- und Sozialwis- senschaftler entscheiden sich für Tätigkeiten, die verglichen mit anderen Akademikerberufen eher unterdurchschnittlich bezahlt werden. Beispiel 1: Journalismus Es gibt laut Bundesagentur für Arbeit etwa 61 000 Journalisten in Deutschland, von denen die Hälfte fest angestellt ist, die meisten als Redakteure bei Tageszeitungen. Die übrigen arbeiten frei auf Honorarbasis, teilweise mit fest vereinbarten Pauschalen. Für Berufseinsteiger ist es keine Selbst- verständlichkeit, sofort eine Festanstellung zu erhalten; Praktika nach der Ausbildung sind in den Medien üblich. Auch Zeitarbeit und befristete Verträge findet man immer öfter. Sehr begehrt sind Volontariate. Laut Gehaltstarifvertrag für Redakteure bei Tageszeitungen erhalten Volontäre im ersten Ausbildungsjahr knapp 1 700 Euro monatlich, im zweiten Jahr knapp 2 000 Euro. Im ersten Berufsjahr gibt es 2 871 Euro, ab dem siebten Berufs- jahr 1 000 Euro mehr. Bei Redakteuren mit besonderer Ver- antwortung und Leitungsfunktion sind es laut Tarif 4 732 Euro monatlich. Zusätzlich wird ein dreizehntes Gehalt in Höhe von 95 Prozent des Monatsgehalt sowie ein Urlaubsgeld in Höhe von 80 Prozent gezahlt. Die Gehälter in höheren Positionen wie für Ressortleiter und Chefredakteure werden frei verhandelt. Zuneh- mend werden Redakteure jedoch ohne Tarifbindung eingestellt, die Gehälter sind dann in der Regel (teilweise deutlich) niedriger.

then 37 Beispiel 2: Arbeit in Verbänden und Stiftungen Als Referent bei- spielsweise orientiert sich die Bezahlung an dem Tarifvertrag des öffentlichen Dienstes (TVöD). Die Umstellung des früheren Bun- desangestelltentarifvertrags (BAT) auf den neuen TVöD hat bei den Berufseinsteigern zu einer Einkommensminderung geführt. Beispielsweise liegt heute das Einstiegsgehalt für einen 29-jähri- gen ledigen Angestellten etwas über 3 000 Euro brutto monatlich und damit um 400 Euro niedriger als beim früheren BAT (Quelle: Bundesagentur für Arbeit: »Arbeitsmarktinformation für Sozial- wissenschaftler«, siehe Literaturhinweise). Auch in höheren Positionen bleiben die Gehälter vergleichsweise niedrig. Das zeigt eine Studie des Bundesverbands deutscher Stif- tungen. Hauptamtliche Geschäftsführer in Stiftungen verdienen demnach 59 000 Euro im Jahr. Die sonst in der Privatwirtschaft üblichen Zusatzleistungen in Führungsjobs wie zum Beispiel einen Firmenwagen erhält nur jeder fünfte Stiftungsmanager. Beispiel 3: Public-Relations-Branche (PR-Agenturen oder Presse- stellen von Unternehmen) Nach Angaben der Deutschen Public Relations Gesellschaft gibt es als PR-Assistent, einer typischen Einstiegsposition für Hochschulabsolventen, 25 132 Euro jähr- lich. PR-Junior-Berater mit erster Berufserfahrung kommen auf 31 539 Euro. In der Position eines Senior-Beraters wird dem Verband zufolge 48 181 Euro gezahlt. Wie die Online-Umfrage lohnspiegel.de der Gewerkschaften zeigt, liegt das Gehalt jedoch mitunter deutlich niedriger. Demnach kommt eine PR-Beraterin mit Vorgesetztenfunktion und zehn Jahren Berufserfahrung auf ein Grundgehalt von nur 34 442 Euro, wenn sie bei einem Arbeit- geber mit weniger als 100 Beschäftigten angestellt ist.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Mythos 2: Frauen verdienen weniger In regelmäßigen Abständen, alle paar Monate, wird eine anschau- liche Statistik veröffentlicht, die zeigt, wie viel weniger Frauen verdienen als Männer. Und doch gibt es Frauen, die ein höheres Gehalt als ihr Kollege oder ihr Nachbar haben – die Statistiken nennen in aller Regel eben nur Durchschnittswerte. Nach einer Auswertung des Portals www.frauenlohnspiegel. de der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, in der 63 000 Gehälter von Män- nern und Frauen verglichen wurden, verdienen Frauen im Schnitt 23 Prozent brutto weniger als Männer. Die Untersuchung zeigt aber auch: Der Gehaltsrückstand ist bei jüngeren Frauen deut- lich kleiner. Bei den Beschäftigten unter 24 Jahren macht er nur 7,8 Prozent aus, bei den Beschäftigten, die 55 Jahre und älter sind, liegt er dagegen bei 26,7 Prozent. Die Erklärung: Jüngere Frauen sind höher qualifiziert als ihre älteren Kolleginnen, au- ßerdem liegen sie mit den Männern bei den Berufsjahren noch gleichauf, während die Männer später, wenn Frauen im Zuge von Schwangerschaft und Elternzeit berufliche Auszeiten nehmen, ihren Kolleginnen bei Gehalt und Karriere häufig davonziehen. Die Umfrage zeigt außerdem, dass die Einkommensunterschiede stark nach Beruf variieren: Bei Verwaltungsfachangestellten bei- spielsweise sind Frauen nur mit 3 Prozent im Rückstand, während Informatikerinnen 15,5 Prozent und Ingenieurinnen 17 Prozent weniger verdienen als ihre männlichen Kollegen. Auch das Statistische Bundesamt hat auf Basis der Gehalts- daten von Männern und Frauen aus dem Jahr 2001 die durch- schnittlichen Verdienstunterschiede analysiert.

then 39 höheren Vergütungsniveau beschäftigt sind. Beides hat die Unterschiede deutlich gesenkt. Mit den Leistungsgruppen konn- ten bei den Angestellten 43 Prozent der Verdienstdifferenzen er- klärt werden, mit den Wirtschaftszweigen 12 Prozent. Das heißt auch: Vollständig lassen sich die Verdienstunterschiede so also nicht erklären. Aber es zeigt, dass ein großer Einflussfaktor auch die Berufs- wahl von Frauen ist. Sie entscheiden sich häufig für deutlich schlechter bezahlte Tätigkeiten, die zudem kaum Aufstiegsmög- lichkeiten bieten, wie beispielsweise Arzthelferin und Erzieherin. Die Hans-Böckler-Stiftung hat das Einstiegsgehalt für je einen ty- pischen Frauen- und Männerberuf berechnet: Eine Einzelhandels- kauffrau – das ist die beliebteste Ausbildung von Frauen – verdient nach der dreijährigen Ausbildung 1 575 Euro brutto (in Nord- rhein-Westfalen), ein Industriemechaniker steigt, zum Beispiel in der Kautschukindustrie in Hessen, dagegen mit 2 023 Euro ein.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Berufsforscher wissen, dass hinter der schlechteren Bezah- lung von typischen Frauenberufen auch Diskriminierung steckt: Warum ist der Gesellschaft zum Beispiel der Beruf einer Erzie- herin weniger wert als der eines Maurers? In ihrem Frauendaten- report für das WSI-Institut der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung zeigt die Wissenschaftlerin Astrid Ziegler, dass auch Tarifverträge nicht geschlechtsneutral sind. Tätigkeiten werden unterschiedlich oder gar nicht bewertet – und erhöhen entsprechend den Lohn oder eben nicht. So werden körperliche Belastungen bei männerdomi- nierten Tätigkeiten stärker bewertet als in der Altenpflege, in der viele Frauen arbeiten. Außerdem werden Anforderungen, die für typische Frauenberufe nötig sind, wie Kommunikationsfähigkeit, gar nicht erst berücksichtigt. Die niedrigeren Verdienste von Frauen und ihre Jobpausen, die sie aufgrund der Familienbetreuung nehmen, wirken sich auch später noch auf ihr Einkommen aus. Über ein ganzes Erwerbsle- ben betrachtet, kommen Frauen nur auf 42 Prozent der Männer- einkommen. Das bedeutet gravierende Einschnitte bei der Rente: Ihre Renten betragen im Schnitt nur 60 Prozent der Männerrenten im Osten und weniger als 50 Prozent im Westen, wie eine Analyse für den Bundestag zeigt, bei der die Geburtsjahrgänge zwischen 1936 und 1955 untersucht wurden. Bescheidene Chefinnen Auch zu wenige weibliche Führungskräfte in Deutschland dämpfen die Durchschnittsgehälter von Frauen. Ihr Anteil an allen Führungsjobs beträgt 30 Prozent, wenn man auch Tätig- keiten, die eine hohe Qualifikation erfordern, mit einbezieht (Quelle: Studie des DIW Berlin).

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Wie die Studie zeigt, lässt sich die unterschiedliche Bezahlung teilweise damit erklären, dass Frauen überdurchschnittlich häu- fig in kleineren Unternehmen und in Branchen arbeiten, in denen geringere Vergütungen üblich sind, und sie zudem niedrigere Füh- rungspositionen innehaben. Aber gibt es noch weitere Faktoren? Was ist beispielsweise mit der Familienpause? Sie wird häufig als Grund genannt, warum Frauen weniger verdienen. In der Regel nehmen Mütter, nicht Väter, eine berufliche Auszeit, und sie sind es überwiegend auch, die Teilzeitjobs ausüben, um Kinder und Beruf unter einen Hut zu bekommen. Laut Statistischem Bundesamt sind bei 37 Prozent der Ehepaare mit Kind ausschließlich die Väter erwerbstätig, bei 5 Prozent ausschließlich die Mütter. Arbeiten Vater und Mutter, so sind bei 73 Prozent der Ehepaare die Väter Vollzeit angestellt, während die Mütter Teilzeit arbeiten. Wie die beiden Wissenschaftler Christine Anger und Jörg Schmidt vom arbeitgebernahen Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft zeigen konnten, wird der Verdienstabstand zwischen Männern und Frauen umso kleiner, je kürzer die berufliche Auszeit ist, die Frauen nach der Geburt eines Kindes nehmen. Am kleinsten ist die Lohnlücke, wenn die Mütter anschließend wieder Vollzeit arbeiten. Durch die Unterbrechung ihrer Erwerbstätigkeit und durch Teilzeitjobs gehen Frauen Beförderungsmöglichkeiten verloren. Führungspositionen in Teilzeit sind in Deutschland rar. Und auch die fehlende Berufserfahrung macht sich beim Gehalt bemerk- bar. Wie eine Führungskräfte-Studie des Instituts für Arbeits- markt- und Berufsforschung belegt, haben Frauen statistisch die höchste Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine Führungsposition im Alter von 32 Jahren.

Bei Männern ist das nicht der Fall. Selbst Frauen, die keine Kinder bekommen und dem Arbeitsmarkt durchgehend zur Verfügung stehen, spüren dieses Phänomen: »Unabhängig von ihren individuellen familiären Plänen werden Frauen auf hohen Positionen oft nicht berücksichtigt, weil sie kollektiv eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit haben, wegen Kindern auszufallen«, heißt es in der Studie.

Für Männer sind solche regelmäßigen Gesprä- che selbstverständlich.« Verhandeln Frauen falsch? Dem spannenden Thema der Verhandlungsforschung widmet sich an der Universität Tübingen die Wirtschaftswissenschaftlerin Uta Herbst: »Viele Frauen sind weniger zielorientiert. Männer setzen sich konkrete Ziele und verhandeln dadurch sehr selbstbestimmt. Frauen machen schneller Kompromisse. Das führt in Verhandlun- gen, in denen kurzfristige Ergebnisse zählen, wie bei Personalge- sprächen, dazu, dass sie schlechter abschneiden.« Uta Herbst ist überzeugt, dass Frauen teilweise selbst schuld an den Gehaltsunterschieden sind. Während Männer klar defi- nieren, was sie erreichen wollen, gehen Frauen mit einer anderen Einstellung in die Gehaltsverhandlung: »Hoffentlich geht’s nicht schief. Oder: Auf das Gehalt kommt es mir eigentlich gar nicht so an. Während der Mann sagt: 60 000 Euro will ich erreichen, sagt sich die Frau: Mit allem, was über 50 000 liegt, bin ich zu- frieden.« Was aber können Frauen besser machen, um bei der Höhe ihres Verdienstes nicht hinter ihren männlichen Kollegen zu- rückzustecken? Es bringt viel, sich Argumente genau auf ein vorher festgesetztes Ziel hin zu überlegen und bis zu welchem Gehalt man bereit ist, einen Kompromiss einzugehen.

then 45 Mythos 3: Leistung zahlt sich aus Seit einigen Jahren führen viele Unternehmen zunehmend soge- nannte Leistungsbezahlungen ein. Das bedeutet, dass ein Teil des Gehalts abhängig von der Leistung des Mitarbeiters oder von der Geschäftslage des Unternehmens ausbezahlt wird. Mitunter flie- ßen beide Kriterien ein. Häufig werden auch die Begriffe Bonus, Prämie oder variable Vergütungsbestandteile dafür verwendet. Es ist ganz unterschiedlich geregelt, wie viel Prozent des Gehalts leis- tungsabhängig bezahlt werden. Das hängt auch von der Position und dem Beruf des Beschäftigten ab. Mit der Hierarchieebene steigt der leistungsbezogene Anteil an der Gesamtvergütung, und in Bereichen, die mit Vertrieb und Verkauf zu tun haben, ist er höher als beispielsweise für eine Sekretärin. Tipp: Als Frau sollten Sie sich mehr mit dem Thema Gehalt auseinan- dersetzen. Ist Ihnen die Höhe Ihres Einkommens wichtig? Wenn ja, kommen Sie nicht umhin, bei Ihrer Berufs- und Studienwahl auf den Faktor Gehalt zu achten. Später im Job kommt es darauf an, dass Sie Ihr Licht nicht unter den Scheffel stellen. Die männlichen Kollegen machen vor, wie es geht: Sie nennen ihre Leistungen, fordern Ent- wicklungsmöglichkeiten, sprechen das Thema Gehalt und Gehalts- erhöhung an – anstatt bescheiden darauf zu warten, dass der Chef von sich aus mehr bietet. Wenn die Phase der Familiengründung kommt, gilt es gemeinsam mit dem Partner bewusst zu entscheiden, wer wann wie beruflich für die Kinder zurücktritt. Es ist heute mög- lich (und oft nötig), Beruf und Kind(er) unter einen Hut zu bringen. Wer dabei auch noch Karriere machen will, bekommt auch das hin.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Teilhabe am Unternehmensgewinn Deutschlandweit werden etwa 12 Prozent aller Arbeitnehmer von ihren Arbeitgebern am Unternehmensgewinn beteiligt, das zeigt eine Untersuchung des Instituts für Arbeitsmarkt- und Be- rufsforschung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (IAB). Vor allem in größeren Unternehmen ist diese Art der Mitarbeiterbeteiligung, die auf Betriebsebene oder individuell ausgehandelt wird, ver- breitet. Allerdings profitieren nicht alle Mitarbeiter gleichermaßen davon. Im Schnitt erhalten nur knapp zwei Drittel der Belegschaft diese Sonderzahlung – Leistung zahlt sich also nicht für jeden aus. Gewinnbeteiligungen sind sogar sehr ungleich verteilt und vor allem unter hoch qualifizierten Angestellten verbreitet. Bei diesen stieg der Anteil an Gewinnbeteiligungen zwischen 1995 und 2005 sogar: von 15 Prozent auf 24 Prozent, so eine Untersuchung der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung. Ein Beispiel: Von den Arbeitnehmern, die mehr als 7 000 Euro brutto verdienen, erhält ein Drittel diese Sonderzahlung. In der Einkommensklasse bis 1 500 Euro sind es dagegen nur 3 Prozent. Auch wie hoch die Gewinnbeteiligung ist, hängt von der Qua- lifikation und der Position ab. Einfache Angestellte erhalten im Schnitt 690 Euro, hoch qualifizierte Mitarbeiter gleich ein paar Tausend Euro mehr: 6 640 Euro. Auch in manchen Tarifverträgen sind vom Betriebsergebnis abhängige Zahlungen vorgesehen. Das sind zum Beispiel Ein- malzahlungen zu einem bestimmten Prozentsatz (in der Chemie- industrie waren es 2007 0,7 Prozent eines Monatsgehalts), die aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen seitens des Arbeitgebers gekürzt wer- den oder sogar wegfallen können, oder auch Pauschalzahlungen.

Geht es dem Unternehmen gut, gibt es mehr, geht es dem Unternehmen schlecht, weniger. Im Bankgewerbe schwankt das Weihnachtsgeld beispielsweise zwischen 90 und 120 Prozent eines Monatsgehalts. Wie sehr die Gewinnbeteiligung bei größeren Unternehmen verbreitet ist, zeigt auch eine Untersuchung der Dax-30-Unter- nehmen der Unternehmensberatung Heinrich-Heine-Consulting der Universität Düsseldorf und der VDI Nachrichten . Demnach beteiligen 87 Prozent der Dax-Unternehmen ihre Mitarbeiter am Firmenerfolg (untersucht wurden nur die Tarifbeschäftigten). Meistens ist die Erfolgsbeteiligung unterschiedlich hoch, weil sie sich unter anderem an der individuellen Leistung, der Betriebs- zugehörigkeit und der Position ausrichtet. Bei ThyssenKrupp werden auch Verbesserungsvorschläge der Mitarbeiter und der Krankenstand berücksichtigt. Bei einigen Arbeitgebern gibt es auch Aktienprogramme für die Beschäftigten. Die Deutsche Bank zum Beispiel beschenkt alle Mitarbeiter jährlich mit zehn Gratis- aktien.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Mehr Geld bei persönlichem Einsatz Wie die Erfolgsbeteiligung der Dax-Unternehmen zeigt, koppeln viele Arbeitgeber Boni-Systeme an die persönliche Leistung der Mitarbeiter, um so die Beschäftigten zu mehr Leistung anzuspor- nen. Wie eine Auswertung der Vergütungsberatung Personalmarkt von 1,2 Millionen Gehaltsdaten zeigt, beziehen insgesamt bereits ein Viertel der Fachkräfte und mehr als die Hälfte der Führungs- kräfte Boni, die sowohl vom Unternehmenserfolg als auch vom persönlichen Einsatz abhängig sein können. Die variablen Gehaltsbestandteile nehmen mit Berufserfahrung und in höheren Positionen an Bedeutung zu. Das zeigt anschau- lich die Gehaltsanalyse des Berufsverbands VDI für Ingenieure: So erhalten bei den Ingenieuren 56,4 Prozent der Berufseinsteiger variable Gehaltsbestandteile, mit zwei Jahren Berufserfahrung sind es bereits 69,8 Prozent. Vertraglich wird festgelegt, wie hoch dieser Bonus ist. Damit die Leistung der Mitarbeiter überhaupt gemessen werden kann, wird regelmäßig in sogenannten Zielvereinbarungen für jeden Mitarbeiter individuell festgelegt, was er in einem bestimmen Zeitraum – in der Regel ein Jahr – erreichen soll. Hat der Mit- arbeiter seinen Chef überzeugt, erhält er den vollen Bonus, bei unvollständiger Erfüllung entsprechend weniger. Welche Ziele und Kriterien vereinbart werden, ist ganz unterschiedlich und ab- hängig von der Branche und vom jeweiligen Arbeitgeber. Die Höhe des Bonus unterscheidet sich ebenfalls, empfohlen wird ein Anteil von mindestens 5 bis 10 Prozent vom Gesamt- gehalt, damit er für den Beschäftigten überhaupt spürbar ist.

In einem Vergleich des Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln von leistungs- und erfolgsabhängigen Prämien, die also sowohl vom persönlichen Einsatz als auch vom Unternehmensergebnis abhängen, gibt es die höchsten Zahlungen demnach bei Banken und Versicherungen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Nach einer Studie der Personalberatung Towers Perrin stehen Mitarbeiter der variablen Bezahlung zurückhaltend gegenüber, und häufig seien sie nicht bereit, einen Teil ihres Fixgehalts wie das Weihnachts- oder Urlaubsgeld in einen variablen, erfolgsab- hängigen Teil zu tauschen. Und das selbst, wenn sie damit mehr verdienen könnten. Kritisch zu sehen ist auch, dass von Leistungsbezahlungen vor allem höhere Berufsgruppen profitieren. Die Möglichkeit, sein Gehalt über mehr Leistung zu steigern, ist also sehr ungleich verteilt. Außerdem kann die Leistungsbezahlung keine echte Gehaltserhöhung ersetzen. Die gewerkschaftliche Hans-Böckler- Stiftung stellt in einer Studie zur erfolgsabhängigen Vergütung fest, dass die Beschäftigten langfristig verlieren, wenn Einkom- menserhöhungen nur noch über Boni realisiert werden: »Je höher die ertragsabhängigen Einkommensbestandteile ausfallen, desto günstiger entwickelt sich die Kostensituation der Unternehmen. Das bedeutet aber auch, dass der Spielraum für tabellenwirksame Erhöhungen entsprechend schrumpft. Die Beschäftigten verlieren dadurch mittelfristig real an Lohn und Gehalt.« Tipp: Ob nach Leistung bezahlt wird oder nicht, entscheidet das Unternehmen, nicht die Mitarbeiter. Sie sollten aber vor allem bei der Gehaltsverhandlung gut aufpassen, um richtig zu verhandeln und damit Sie wissen, was auf Sie zukommt. Die beiden wichtigsten Punkte sind: 1. Boni werden in der Regel zeitverzögert ausgezahlt. Wenn sie vom Unternehmenserfolg abhängig sind, erst nach Ende des Geschäftsjahres, sobald die Zahlen feststehen. 2. Die Höhe der Boni ist nicht garantiert. Laufen die Geschäfte schlecht, gibt es weniger oder gar nichts. Aber auch die Arbeitgeber müssen bei der Einführung von Leis- tungsbezahlung aufpassen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! den Seiten hat Recht? Folgend werden sieben gängige Klischees einer Überprüfung unterzogen: Klischee 1: Die Managergehälter steigen und steigen Das stimmt, für die Verdienste der Unternehmenslenker scheint es nach oben keine Grenze zu geben. In den 100 größten Unter- nehmen mit mehr als 5 Milliarden Euro Jahresumsatz gab es in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten erhebliche Zuwächse. Hier sind die Vorstandsgehälter von 1976 bis 2005 von durchschnittlich 225 000 Euro auf 1,8 Millionen Euro im Jahr gestiegen. Das entspricht einer durchschnittlichen jährlichen Steigerung von 7,5 Prozent (Quelle: Kienbaum). In den restlichen untersuchten Aktiengesellschaften stiegen die Bezüge von 132 000 Euro auf 440 000 Euro, also um jährlich 4,25 Prozent. Noch besser geht es den Managern in den 30 Dax-Unterneh- men. Dort ist die Vorstandsvergütung seit 1987 um 650 Prozent gestiegen. Wie Kienbaum vorrechnet, verdiente ein Dax-Vorstand 1987 im Jahr 445 800 Euro. Inzwischen sind es mehr als 3 Mil- lionen, genau: 3 334 000 Euro. Wie es bei den Dax-Unternehmen im vergangenen Geschäfts- jahr aussah, zeigen die Geschäftsberichte, in denen die börsenno- tierten Unternehmen die Gehälter ihrer Vorstände veröffentlichen. Im Jahr 2007 sind die Vorstandsbezüge der 30 größten deutschen Aktiengesellschaften insgesamt leicht gesunken, obwohl die ver- steuerten Gewinne der Firmen um 18 Prozent gestiegen sind (Quelle: Süddeutsche Zeitung ). Zugelegt haben aber die Vor- standschefs: 22 Konzernchefs verdienten im Schnitt 8,7 Prozent mehr als im Vorjahr.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! das Jahresgehalt eines japanischen Konzernchefs würde ein Dax- Konzernchef nur einen Monat zur Arbeit geben«, schreibt die Süddeutsche Zeitung . Der oberste Sony-Boss erhält beispielsweise 650 000 Dollar im Jahr, die Manager an der Spitze von Toyota etwa 500 000 Dollar. Mehr bekommen tatsächlich manche Chefs in den USA. Trotz seiner 14 Millionen als bestbezahlter deutscher Manager ist Deut- sche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann verglichen mit seinen amerika- nischen Kollegen ein kleines Licht: Beispielsweise zahlte Goldman Sachs seinem Chef Lloyd Blankfein im Jahr 2007 67,9 Millionen Dollar. Die Chefs der Unternehmen im Börsenindex Standard & Poor’s 500 verdienten im Jahr 2007 im Schnitt 8,4 Millionen Dollar. Aber nicht nur die Lenker der Dax-Konzerne verdienen ver- gleichsweise gut. Im Europavergleich liegen deutsche Manager generell im Spitzenfeld. Eine Studie der Unternehmensberatung Kienbaum untersuchte die Vergütung von Führungskräften in Westeuropa im Jahr 2008 anhand der Gehälter von 116 124 Positionen in 3 818 Unternehmen in elf Ländern. Demnach er- hält der Geschäftsführer eines Unternehmens mit bis zu 100 Mitarbeitern in Deutschland europaweit das höchste Gehalt mit 224 000 Euro.

then 55 Klischee 3: Manager nehmen bei ihrem eigenen Gehalt keine Rücksicht auf ihr Unternehmen »Warum wird mit Geld überschüttet, wer auf der ganzen Linie versagt?«, fragte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel auf einem CDU-Parteitag im Jahr 2008 und spielte auf die hohen Abfindun- gen von Managern an. In der Regel sind diese die Auszahlung der Restlaufzeit des Vertrags, wenn ein Vorstand vorzeitig gehen muss. Doch bei einem Abtreten unter unrühmlichen Bedingungen wird die Abfindung von der Öffentlichkeit als zu hoch wahrge- nommen. Einige Beispiele: Der frühere Infineon-Chef Wolfgang Ziebart muss sich wegen seines Weggangs vom Chiphersteller im Mai 2008 keine finan- ziellen Sorgen machen: Sein Vertrag läuft noch bis Herbst 2009, und so lange hat er Anspruch auf sein Gehalt, das zuletzt bei 2 Millionen Euro jährlich lag – plus das Recht auf eine jährliche Firmenrente in Höhe von 560 000 Euro und auf ein einmaliges Ruhestandsgeld in Höhe von 860 000 Euro. Und das, obwohl In- fineon unter seiner Führung ein Minus von 368 Millionen Euro machte. Klaus Kleinfeld erhielt bei seinem Weggang von Siemens eine Sonderzahlung in Höhe von 5,75 Millionen Euro, obwohl sein Vertrag regulär ausgelaufen war. Andere Firmenchefs steigern ihre Bezüge, obwohl ihre Fehl- entscheidungen ihrem Unternehmen teuer zu stehen kamen: 2008 geriet der Vorstand der Axel Springer AG in die Kritik. Die Entscheidung, 2007 beim Postdienstleister PIN die Mehrheit zu übernehmen, bedeutete für das Verlagshaus einen Verlust von 238 Millionen Euro.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! worden. Außerdem habe sich der operative Gewinn deutlich ver- bessert. Jochen Sanio, der Chef der Finanzaufsicht Bafin, macht die Vergütungspakete der Manager sogar für Fehlentscheidungen verantwortlich. »Die gewinnabhängige Bezahlung von Top-Ma- nagern setzt den starken Anreiz, die Gewinne kurzfristig zu stei- gern. Das geht meist nur, wenn man höhere – zu hohe – Risiken in Kauf nimmt«, sagte er der Wochenzeitung Die Zeit . Klischee 4: Gehälter von Managern und Mitarbeitern driften zu weit auseinander Das stimmt, die Schere geht immer weiter auf. Deutsche-Bank- Chef Josef Ackermann erhält inzwischen alleine so viel Gehalt wie 310 Privatkundenberater zusammen. Die Relation bei Por- sche-Chef Wendelin Wiedeking ist noch krasser: Er soll im Jahr 2007 60 Millionen Euro verdient haben und damit mehr als das Tausendfache des Durchschnittslohns der Arbeiter in der Auto- mobilindustrie. Aber auch weniger bekannte Vorstandschefs hängen ihre Mit- arbeiter beim Gehalt unvorstellbar weit ab. Wie die Kienbaum- Studie zur Entwicklung der Vorstandsvergütung in 30 Jahren zeigt, haben sich die Gehälter von Firmenlenkern und Angestell- ten in diesem Zeitraum extrem auseinanderentwickelt. Bei den Top-100-Unternehmen verdienten die obersten Bosse zwischen den Jahren 1976 und 1996 ungefähr das 15- bis 20fache ihrer Angestellten, heute liegt der Unterschied bei 43:1. Dafür haben die Angestellten gegenüber dem mittleren Management leicht aufgeholt.

then 57 Dabei ist in Unternehmen mit Staatsbeteiligung die Einkom- mensschere zwischen Boss und Mitarbeitern besonders groß. Bei der Deutschen Post verdiente im Jahr 2006 ein Vorstandsmitglied 87 Mal so viel wie ein Mitarbeiter. Im Jahr 1995 war es nur elf Mal so viel. Klischee 5: Hohe Managergehälter bestimmt nun mal der Markt Wie kommt es, dass Josef Ackermann in nur einem Jahr 14 Mil- lionen Euro verdient? Die Höhe der Vorstandsbezüge bestimmt der Aufsichtsrat einer Aktiengesellschaft. Sie orientiert sich an der Größe des Unternehmens, gemessen an Umsatz- oder Beschäftig- tenzahl. Dabei können die Gehälter von einem Jahr zum anderen extrem schwanken, was daran liegt, dass es neben einem fixen Grundgehalt einen hohen variablen Vergütungsanteil gibt, der er- folgsabhängig ist und durch seine Kopplung an die Ertragssituation des Unternehmens mit der Höhe des Jahresüberschusses steigt. Dieser variable Bestandteil ist in den vergangenen Jahren immer größer geworden, er macht inzwischen einen Großteil des gesamten Gehalts aus. Zusätzlich erhalten die Firmenlenker Aktienoptionen, sodass sich eine Steigerung des Aktienkurses also für sie auszahlt. Wie eine Studie der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapier- besitz zeigt, erhalten die Vorstandsvorsitzenden der 30 Dax-Unter- nehmen durchschnittlich aktienkursbasierte Einkommenskompo- nenten von einer Million Euro. Im Schnitt werden 23 Prozent der Gesamtvergütung (ohne Pensionsansprüche) in Form aktienbasier- ter Vergütungsbestandteile gewährt.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! In Deutschland fordern Gewerkschaften und Politiker immer wieder Obergrenzen für die Bezüge von Vorstandsmitgliedern. Nach einem Konzept der SPD sollen die Unternehmen Vorstands- gehälter und Abfindungen nur noch bis zu einer Million Euro pro Vorstand von der Steuer absetzen dürfen. Für größere Unter- nehmen würde das eine jährliche Mehrbelastung von mehreren Millionen Euro bedeuten. Der Deutsche Corporate Governance Kodex (DCGK), der Regeln für eine gute Unternehmensführung festlegt, empfiehlt, Abfindungen bei vorzeitiger Auflösung des Vertrags auf höchstens zwei Jahre zu beschränken. Auch die Europäische Union will zu hohen Managementgehältern, beson- ders Abfindungen, europaweit einen Riegel vorschieben. Gerhard Cromme, der erste Vorsitzende des DCGK, hat vorge- schlagen, die Managergehälter stärker an den langfristigen Erfolg eines Unternehmens zu koppeln. Zum Beispiel könnten Teile der erfolgsabhängigen Vergütung ausgezahlt werden, nachdem sich die Nachhaltigkeit der Managemententscheidungen erwiesen hat. Seit 2007 müssen börsennotierte Unternehmen die individu- ellen Gehälter ihrer Vorstände veröffentlichen. Verbunden war diese neue Pflicht zu mehr Transparenz mit der Hoffnung, dass die Gehälter nicht weiter in die Höhe schnellen. Tatsächlich je- doch scheinen die Bezüge eher zu steigen. »Die Transparenz hat sicher manchem geholfen, seine Situation zu verbessern«, sagte der Münchner Wirtschaftswissenschaftler Manuel Theisen der Süddeutschen Zeitung . Denselben Effekt hatte die Offenlegung der Vorstandsgehälter in angelsächsischen Ländern.

then 59 in der Regel auf die Chefs der großen Konzerne. In kleineren Unternehmen streichen die Firmenlenker deutlich bescheidenere Gehälter ein: Sie reichen von weniger als 40 000 Euro bis über 400 000 Euro (Quelle: Kienbaum). Dabei verdient ein Drittel der Geschäftsführer weniger als 110 000 Euro, ein Drittel erhält ein Gehalt zwischen 110 000 und 155 000 Euro und ein Drittel mehr als 155 000 Euro. Den stärksten Einfluss auf die Höhe des Ge- halts hat die Unternehmensgröße. Ein Geschäftsführer, der ein Unternehmen mit mehr als 5 000 Beschäftigten lenkt, bekommt ein durchschnittliches Jahresgesamtgehalt von 245 000 Euro. Ein Geschäftsführer, der einem Betrieb mit bis zu fünf Mitarbeitern vorsteht, kommt im Schnitt auf 96 000 Euro. Auch die Aufsichtsräte deutscher Konzerne bleiben im Ver- gleich mit den millionenverwöhnten Vorstandsmitgliedern be- scheiden. Im Schnitt verdient ein Aufsichtsrat, dessen wichtigste Aufgabe die Kontrolle des Vorstandes ist, 18 000 Euro im Jahr, in den Dax-Unternehmen 125 000 Euro. Seit 1964 sind die Bezüge der Aufsichtsräte um das Zweieinhalbfache gestiegen. Damals verdiente ein Aufsichtsrat 13 Prozent des Gehalts eines Vorstan- des, heute sind es 4 Prozent. Zu den Spitzenverdienern unter den Aufsichtsräten gehören Clemens Börsig (Deutsche Bank) mit 662 667 Euro, Gerhard Cromme (ThyssenKrupp) mit 479 207 Euro und Jürgen Strube (BASF) mit 475 000 Euro. Da viele Aufsichtsräte mehrere Mandate in verschiedenen Unternehmen ausüben, können auch so Millionensummen zu- sammenkommen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Klischee 7: Alle Manager sind geldgierig Das stimmt so nicht. In die Debatte um überzogene Manager- gehälter gelangen hin und wieder Nachrichten bescheidener Fir- menlenker. Als solcher wurde beispielsweise Klaus-Peter Müller bekannt, der vom Vorstand in den Aufsichtsrat der Commerz- bank wechselte und dabei auf die Auszahlung seines Vorstands- vertrages verzichtete, der noch bis 2010 gelaufen wäre und ihm zweimal 3,5 Millionen Euro eingebracht hätte. Als Aufsichtsrat wird er etwa 230 000 Euro verdienen. »Wir Manager sollten uns selbst beschränken,« sagte Müller zu den hohen Bezügen, die sich ab einer bestimmten Höhe einfach nicht mehr vermitteln ließen. Auch Michael Rogowski, Ex-Präsident des Bundesverbands der Deutschen Industrie, kritisierte zu hohe Gehälter und mahnte, dass diese den Eindruck vermitteln, »der Selbstbedienungsladen sei bei uns an der Tagesordnung«.

then 61 hälter ändern sich nicht. Außerdem bedeutet eine Gehaltsanhe- bung nicht, dass die Arbeitnehmer automatisch mehr Geld zur Verfügung haben. Das ist nur dann der Fall, wenn ihr Verdienst stärker steigt als die Inflation und nicht von höheren Abgaben aufgefressen wird. Magere Gehaltssteigerungen Das Jahr 2008 fing gut an. Die Löhne und Gehälter waren be- reits in den ersten Monaten so stark gestiegen wie seit zwölf Jahren nicht mehr. Allein bei einigen Tarifvereinbarungen gab es einen gewaltigen Sprung nach oben, zum Beispiel in der Chemie- industrie (plus 7,7 Prozent) oder im öffentlichen Dienst (mehr als 8 Prozent). Doch die hohen Tarifabschlüsse täuschen. Die Gewerkschaften rechneten im Durchschnitt mit einem Plus von etwas über 3 Pro- zent. Auch die Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute prognostizierten für das Jahr 2008 durchschnittliche Lohnerhöhungen in diesem Rahmen. 3 Prozent, das ist doch immerhin etwas, möchte man meinen. Doch bei hohen Inflationsraten reicht eine solche Lohnerhöhung nicht, damit unterm Strich mehr bleibt. Schon in den Vorjahren mussten die Arbeitnehmer Nullrunden hinnehmen oder sich mit noch magereren Erhöhungen bescheiden, die Differenz zwischen Gehaltszuwachs und Teuerung sorgte dafür, dass trotz leichter Gehaltserhöhungen die Arbeitnehmer von Jahr zu Jahr weniger in der Tasche hatten. Und das wird leider auch für das Jahr 2008 gelten. Trotz einzelner hoher Tarifabschlüsse werden die Durchschnittsein- kommen nicht stark steigen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! befürchte, dass die Löhne in Deutschland über viele Jahre weiter stagnieren werden«, prognostiziert Hans-Werner Sinn, der Leiter des Münchner Forschungsinstituts ifo. Nettoreallöhne sinken Von Politik und Arbeitgeberseite gab es Lob für die jahrelange Lohnzurückhaltung der Arbeitnehmer in wirtschaftlich schwie- rigen Zeiten. Doch für die Beschäftigten bedeuteten die mageren oder ausbleibenden Gehaltssteigerungen, dass sie tatsächlich netto immer weniger Geld zur Verfügung hatten, um ihre Ausgaben zu decken. Vor allem einkommensschwächeren Haushalten macht die Infla- tionsrate zu schaffen. Sie geben einen Großteil ihres Einkommens für den alltäglichen Konsum aus. Im Gegensatz zu reicheren Haus- halten, denen genug Geld zum Sparen bleibt, können sie nicht fle- xibel reagieren, wenn die Preise steigen. Wenn einkommensschwä- chere Haushalte bei hoher Inflation ihren Lebensstandard halten wollen, müssen sie an ihr Erspartes – oder sich verschulden. Auch wurden die mageren Lohnerhöhungen nicht durch staat- liche Transferzahlungen oder Steuererleichterungen wieder wett- gemacht, sondern die staatlichen Leistungen an private Haushalte wie Kindergeld, Bafög oder Renten sind von Ende 2004 bis An- fang 2008 um 6 Prozent gesunken.

then 63 musste, kamen nur 47,80 Euro bei den Beschäftigten an. Von den Abgabensenkungen der vergangenen Jahre haben gerade Durch- schnitts- und Geringverdiener nicht profitiert. Heimliche Steuererhöhung Jeder einzelne zusätzlich verdiente Euro wird in unserem Steuer- system mit einem höheren Steuersatz belegt. Dadurch steigt mit jeder Lohnerhöhung auch die durchschnittliche Belastung des Arbeitnehmers. Berücksichtigt man noch die Inflation, so wird in der Folge die Gehaltserhöhung vollends zur Gehaltsabsenkung. Der Bund der Steuerzahler hat diese »kalte Progression« an einem Beispiel durchgerechnet: Ein Arbeitnehmer erhält jedes Jahr eine Gehaltserhöhung in Höhe der Inflationsrate. Während sein Bruttoeinkommen von 30 937 Euro im Jahr 2007 auf 31 649 Euro in 2008 steigt, also um 2,3 Prozent, muss er 2008 4,25 Prozent mehr Einkommenssteuer zahlen: 5 525 Euro statt 5 300 Euro im Vorgängerjahr – obwohl die Inflation die Gehaltserhöhung auf- frisst. Er hat am Ende weniger Geld zur Verfügung als zuvor. Auch die vergleichsweise hohen Tariferhöhungen im öffentli- chen Dienst, die im Jahr 2008 beschlossen wurden, kommen nur teilweise bei den Beschäftigten an, wie das Beispiel einer Erziehe- rin in der Tabelle 19 auf Seite 65 zeigt. Hohe Sozialabgaben Wie die obigen Beispiele zeigen, schlagen die Sozialabgaben kräf- tig aufs Gehalt. Je nachdem, wie viel ein Arbeitnehmer verdient, zahlt er sogar mehr Sozialabgaben als Steuern.

Was kann ich tun, um meine Situation zu verbessern? Bei mageren Gehaltssteigerungen ist es eine Alternative, auf Gehaltsextras zu setzen. Statt 1,5 Prozent mehr Bruttoverdienst kann es sich lohnen, dass Sie von Ihrem Arbeitgeber zum Beispiel einen Zuschlag für die Kinderbetreuung erhalten. Sol- che Gehaltsextras haben den Vorteil, dass Sie als Arbeitnehmer sie nicht versteuern müssen, und auch Ihr Arbeitgeber profitiert davon, indem er die Sozialabgaben spart. ➔ Tabelle 19: Steuerklasse

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Einige Top-Manager und ein Spitzenpolitiker haben im Jahr 2008 auf Anfrage des Wirtschaftsmagazins Capital die Höhe ihrer Einkommenssteuer offengelegt. Hohe Einkommen unterliegen seit dem Jahr 2007 der »Rei- chensteuer«, das heißt dem Spitzensteuersatz von 45 Prozent. Sie greift ab einem jährlichen Einkommen von 250 000 für Allein- lebende und 500 000 Euro für Verheiratete. Die Mittelschicht schrumpft Laut dem Armuts- und Reichtumsbericht hat die Ungleichheit der Einkommensverteilung in den vergangenen Jahren zuge- nommen: Während es in den oberen Einkommensgruppen auf- wärtsging, sind die unteren Einkommen gesunken. Das bestätigt auch eine Studie des Instituts für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft in Bonn, die die Jahre 1996 bis 2006 untersuchte. Demnach ist die Zahl der Einkommensschwachen um 4,1 Millionen Perso- nen gestiegen, die Bevölkerung nahm in diesem Zeitraum um 0,7 Millionen zu. Wie eine Studie des Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsfor- schung zeigt, muss gerade die Mittelschicht zunehmend Abstriche am Lebensstandard machen. Darunter verstehen die Statistiker alle Personen, die zwischen 70 und 150 Prozent des Durch- schnittseinkommens verdienen. So ist der Anteil der Bezieher mittlerer Einkommen vom Jahr 2000 bis zum Jahr 2006 von 62 auf 54 Prozent zurückgegangen. Das entspricht fünf Millionen Personen.

then 69 Auch der Anteil der Personen, die armutsgefährdet sind, hat deutlich zugenommen. Der Anteil der Reichen, die mehr als 200 Prozent des Durch- schnittseinkommens verdienen, ist dagegen innerhalb von zehn Jahren von 6,4 auf 9,2 Prozent gestiegen ist. Die Unternehmensberatung McKinsey warnte 2008 in einer Studie davor, dass sich das Schrumpfen der Mittelschicht weiter verstärken könnte. Millionen Deutschen würde in den nächsten zwölf Jahren der Abstieg aus der Mittelschicht drohen, wenn es nicht zu einem höheren Wirtschaftswachstum kommt. Im Jahr 2020 gehörten dann nur noch 50 Prozent der Deutschen zur Mit- telschicht. »Das Wirtschaftswachstum, das wir in den vergange- nen 15 Jahren verzeichnen konnten, hat nicht gereicht, um bei den Bürgern anzukommen«, erläutert der Deutschland-Chef von McKinsey, Frank Mattern. Immer mehr Arme Die Armut in Deutschland nimmt seit Jahren zu. Als arm gilt, wer weniger als 60 Prozent des durchschnittlichen Einkommens zur Verfügung hat.

Armutsforschern zufolge liegt die Armutsquote jedoch in Wirklichkeit höher. Das zeigen Zahlen aus dem sozio-ökonomi- schen Panel, einer jährlichen Befragung von 20 000 Deutschen.

Besonders betroffen seien wenig qualifizierte Arbeiter. Erschreckend deutlich hat sich die Kinderarmut in den ver- gangenen Jahren verbreitet. Nach einer 2008 vorgestellten Unicef-Studie wächst die Kinderarmut deutlich stärker als die Armut unter Erwachsenen. Besonders betroffen sind die Kinder Alleinerziehender und aus Migrantenfamilien. So gelten 40 Pro- zent der Kinder Alleinerziehender als arm. Unicef legte in der Studie die Armutsgrenze allerdings etwas niedriger: bei 50 Pro- zent des Durchschnittseinkommens. Nach den Angaben des Deutschen Kinderhilfswerk wachsen heute in Deutschland drei Millionen Kinder und Jugendliche in Armut auf. »Kinderarmut ist spätestens mit Hartz IV zu einem Kardinalproblem unserer Gesellschaft geworden«, warnt Chris- toph Butterwege von der Universität Köln. Arm trotz Arbeit Viele Deutsche sind arm, obwohl sie eine feste Arbeitsstelle haben. Sie erhalten so niedrige Löhne, dass der Lohn zum Überleben nicht reicht. Damit haben sie Anspruch auf staatliche Unterstützung und können zusätzlich zu ihrem Erwerbseinkommen Hartz-IV- Leistungen beziehen. Darauf sind fast 500 000 Vollzeitbeschäf- tigte angewiesen, zeigt eine Studie des Instituts für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung. Insgesamt beziehen 1,3 Millionen Deutsche neben ihrem beruflichen Gehalt die staatliche Grundsicherung. »Vielen von ihnen reicht der Lohn zwar zum Leben, aber nicht zum Wohnen«, sagt Helmut Rudolph vom Institut für Arbeits- markt- und Berufsforschung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (IAB).

then 71 nahm die Zahl der Beschäftigten, die einen Zweitjob ausüben, deutlich zu. Eine Million Menschen geht regelmäßig einer zwei- ten Beschäftigung nach, so eine Studie des Instituts für Wirt- schaftsforschung Halle (IWH). Weitere 700 000 üben unregel- mäßig Nebenjobs aus. Vor allem Arbeitnehmern mit geringen Qualifikationen bleibt oft nichts anderes übrig, als mehrere Jobs parallel auszuüben. Einkommen und Vermögen Die Deutschen verfügen insgesamt über ein Vermögen von 5,4 Bil- lionen Euro. Dazu gehören Ersparnisse, Immobilien, Rentenan- sprüche, Versicherungen und wertvolle Sammlungen von Kunst, Briefmarken und Münzen. Würde man diese 5,4 Billionen auf alle über 17-jährigen Deut- schen gleichmäßig verteilen, dann besäße jeder Einzelne ein Ver- mögen von 81 000 Euro. Tatsächlich ist der Reichtum aber sehr ungleich verteilt: Die reichsten 10 Prozent besitzen allein 60 Pro- zent und das oberste Prozent der Reichen verfügt über 20 Prozent des gesamten Vermögens. Rund zwei Drittel der Deutschen über 17 Jahre haben dagegen so gut wie gar nichts (Studie des Deut- schen Instituts für Wirtschaftsforschung). Doch die Vermögen sind nicht nur ungleich verteilt, die Reichen werden auch immer reicher. Die ökonomische Elite, darunter verste- hen die Reichtumsforscher die 0,001 Prozent der oberen Einkom- mensbezieher – das sind 650 Personen –, konnte ihre Einkommen von 1992 bis 2001 um 35 Prozent steigern.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! merischer Tätigkeit. Laut Deutschem Institut für Wirtschaftsfor- schung (DIW) ist die zunehmende Ungleichheit auf die schwache Lohnentwicklung, die gestiegene Arbeitslosigkeit im untersuchten Zeitraum sowie die Erhöhung der Gewinne und Vermögensein- kommen zurückzuführen. Denn die ökonomische Elite bezieht nur etwa 5 Prozent ihres Einkommens aus Gehältern (mehr als 80 Pro- zent des Einkommens beim Durchschnitt der Bevölkerung). Fast 70 Prozent ihres Einkommens kommt aus ihrer unternehmerischen Tätigkeit, mehr als ein Viertel aus Vermögensgewinnen. Die Analyse des DIW basiert auf der Einkommenssteuersta- tistik von 2001. Doch jüngere Studien zeigen, dass sich die Un- gleichheit der Einkommen weiter verstärkt. Gehälter und Ein- kommen aus Vermögen und Unternehmensgewinnen entwickeln sich immer weiter auseinander. Von 2003 bis 2007 legten die Gewinne der Unternehmen und die Kapitaleinkommen um 36,7 Prozent zu. Das führt dazu, dass die Löhne und Gehälter einen immer kleineren Teil des gesamten Volkseinkommens ausmachen. Die Nettolohnquote, also der An- teil des verfügbaren Volkseinkommens, der nach Abzug von Steu- ern und Abgaben übrig bleibt, beträgt nur noch 38,8 Prozent. Mitarbeiterbeteiligung Unternehmensgewinne und Arbeitnehmereinkommen haben sich in den vergangenen Jahren immer weiter voneinander entfernt. Um diese Kluft zu verringern, möchte die Politik die Mitarbeiterbeteili- gung ausbauen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! vergangenen Jahren stark verbreitet, sie ist häufig im Dienstleis- tungssektor und im Gesundheitsbereich anzutreffen, vor allem bei den Kulturberufen hat sie deutlich zugenommen. Für manche ist sie eine Übergangslösung, andere versuchen auf Dauer, auf diese Weise ihr Erwerbseinkommen zu bestreiten. Das entscheidende Kriterium ist: Selbstständige tragen selbst das Risiko für ihr Unternehmen und verfügen frei über ihre Arbeitskraft. Sie zahlen keine Sozialversicherungsbeiträge, was bedeutet, dass sie für den Krankheitsfall und später für das Alter selbst vorsorgen müssen. Die Einkommenssituation der Selbstständigen Da sich die Gruppe der Selbstständigen so heterogen darstellt, ist es schwierig, allgemeine Aussagen über ihre Einkommenssitu- ation zu machen. Wie will man den kleinen Einzelhändler, der einen Gemüsestand um die Ecke betreibt, mit dem Inhaber eines großen Industrieunternehmens vergleichen? Im Durchschnitt aller Selbstständigen-Haushalte liegen deren Einkommen verglichen mit anderen Bevölkerungsgruppen hoch. Wie die volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen des Statistischen Bundesamts zeigen, haben sie verglichen mit Arbeitnehmern und Beamten die höchsten Einkommen zur Verfügung und zwischen 1991 und 2005 die höchsten Einkommenssteigerungen. Diese Durchschnittswerte sagen allerdings wenig über die individuellen Schicksale aus, wie die Tabelle auf der folgenden Seite zeigt.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Übersetzern verdienen 80 Prozent bis zu 20 000 Euro im Jahr. Bei den freien Lektoren verdient jeder Dritte unter 10 000 Euro. Am bes- ten schneiden in ihrer Untersuchung die Journalisten ab, bei denen immerhin 12 Prozent auf mehr als 40 000 Euro pro Jahr kommen.

then 77 Besonders von Altersarmut bedroht sind diejenigen Selbstständi- gen, die ohne Angestellte arbeiten. Viele verdienen kaum genug, um noch fürs Alter vorzusorgen. Mythos 8: Über Gehälter spricht man nicht Die Deutschen gehen mit ihrem Gehalt scheu um. Einerseits würden sie zwar gerne wissen, was der Nachbar, Kollege oder sogar Chef verdient. Andererseits möchten sie sich selbst nicht gern in die Gehaltsabrechnung oder ins Portemonnaie schauen lassen. In manchen Arbeitsverträgen steht sogar eine Verschwie- genheitsklausel: Über das vereinbarte Gehalt soll und darf man nicht reden. Andererseits bleibt einem ja bei der gemeinsamen Steuererklärung mit dem Ehepartner nichts anderes übrig. Auch Tipp: Der Schritt in die Selbstständigkeit muss gut überlegt und vor- bereitet sein. Es gibt inzwischen viele Informations- und Beratungs- angebote, auch im Internet. Das Bundeswirtschaftsministerium bietet mit dem Portal existenzgruender.de eine ideale erste Anlaufstelle. Hier können Sie beispielsweise online testen, ob Sie ein »Unternehmertyp« sind. Dazu gehört auch, dass Sie dauerhaft zu hohem Arbeitseinsatz bereit sind. Wie die Stern -Umfrage zeigt, arbeiten Selbstständige deutlich mehr als Festangestellte, und eine 60-Stunden-Woche ist für die meisten völlig normal. Eine sehr gute Vorbereitung ist die beste Versicherung dafür, dass eine Existenzgründung nicht schiefgeht. Die Gründe für eine Pleite sind vor allem: Schwierigkeiten mit der Finan- zierung, mangelnde Information und fehlende fachliche Qualifikation, schlechte Planung, Probleme mit der Familie und eine

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! wer eine Wohnung sucht, wird in der Regel aufgefordert, seine Einkünfte offenzulegen. Was soll also die Zurückhaltung? Sollten und können wir mit unserem Gehalt offener umgehen? Grundsätzlich gilt, dass jeder frei über sein Gehalt sprechen darf. Eine Ausnahme von dieser Regel liegt jedoch vor, wenn man in seinem Arbeitsvertrag eine Verschwiegenheitsklausel unterschrie- ben hat. Diese sollte man auch ernst nehmen, wie der Heidelberger Rechtsanwalt Michael Eckert erklärt: »Wir hatten einmal den Fall, dass ein Arbeitnehmer zu außergewöhnlich guten Bedingungen eingestellt wurde. Leider prahlte er im Kollegenkreis damit. Man kann sich vorstellen, dass so ein Verhalten den Betriebsfrieden enorm stört. Der Arbeitgeber hat das Verhalten dann abgemahnt.« Mehr Offenheit: Gehaltsumfragen boomen Die Transparenz bei Gehältern hat in den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland deutlich zugenommen. Gewerkschaften, Berufsver- bände und Personalberatungen analysieren regelmäßig den Markt für verschiedene Berufe und Branchen. Die Ergebnisse sind in der Regel, wenn auch nicht immer im Detail, öffentlich zugänglich; Adressen und Links finden Sie im Anhang ab Seite 185. Eine wichtige Rolle spielt das von der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung getragene Portal www.lohnspiegel.de. An der dort angebotenen anonymen Gehaltsumfrage kann sich jeder beteiligen, die An- gaben werden wissenschaftlich ausgewertet und in eine Gehalts- datenbank übertragen.

then 79 Einige Personalberatungen bieten kostenpflichtige Analysen an, die den Vorteil haben, auf die individuelle Situation ein- zugehen. Diese Investition lohnt sich, wenn man genau wissen möchte, wo und wie man im Berufs- und Branchenvergleich mit seinem Gehalt steht. Man muss allerdings bereit sein, einen re- gelrechten »Gehaltsstriptease« hinzulegen, also alles über seine Berufs- und Einkommenssituation zu verraten. In der Regel flie- ßen die Angaben dann anonym in den Gehaltspool des Anbieters ein und dienen so auch als Quelle für weitere Auswertungen. In manchen Branchen sind die Gehälter deutlich transparen- ter als in anderen. Ganz vorne liegt dabei die IT-Branche, für die es mehrere und regelmäßige Studien verschiedener Anbieter gibt, darunter beispielsweise die Gewerkschaft IG Metall und die Fachzeitschrift Computerwoche . Auch als Ingenieur ist es leicht, sich über seinen Marktwert zu informieren, zum Beispiel bietet der Berufsverband Verein Deutscher Ingenieure sogar einen kos- tenlosen Gehaltscheck im Internet an. Wenig Mühe macht es auch, sich über Tarifgehälter zu infor- mieren. Die zuständigen Gewerkschaften veröffentlichen die Verträge in der Regel im Internet. Eine berufs- und branchen- übergreifende Übersicht gibt es außerdem beim Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaftlichen Institut der gewerkschaftsnahen Hans- Böckler-Stiftung unter www.tarifspiegel.de. Tipp: Nutzen Sie alle verfügbaren Quellen, wenn Sie unsicher sind, ob Ihr Arbeitgeber Sie angemessen bezahlt. Vor allem Berufsein- steiger profitieren von den Gehaltsübersichten. Auch vor Gehalts- verhandlungen und vor einem Jobwechsel zahlt es sich aus, gut informiert zu sein. Aber Vorsicht: Die Gehälterrankings müssen richtig gelesen wer- den.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Situation übertragen. Schauen Sie sich genau an, welche Berufs- gruppen untersucht wurden und welche Gehaltsbestandteile in der Auswertung erfasst sind. Oft weichen sogar Analysen verschiedener Anbieter zur selben Berufsgruppe voneinander ab. Manchmal wer- den Jahresgehälter erhoben, die üblicherweise auch die Sonder- zahlungen erfassen, manchmal werden Monatsgehälter genannt. Hier muss man noch das Weihnachtsgeld und mögliche Zuschläge dazurechnen. Abweichungen gibt es zudem bei der Erhebung auf Basis unterschiedlicher Arbeitszeiten. Beispielsweise rechnet die IG Metall ihre jährliche Gehälterauswertung für die IT-Branche auf Grundlage einer 35-Stunden-Woche, andere Anbieter gehen von einer 40-Stunden-Woche aus. Auch die Region, in der die Gehälter erhoben wurden, beeinflusst das Ergebnis. Das alles zeigt, dass es auf keinen Fall reicht, sich nur die Zahlen herauszupicken. Im Gegen- teil kann dies zu völlig falschen Vorstellungen führen. Wer wirklich wissen will, ob er mit seinem Gehalt richtig liegt beziehungsweise was in einem bestimmten Umfeld gezahlt wird, kommt nicht umhin, mehrere Studien genau zu studieren. Investieren Sie im Zweifelsfall in eine kostenpflichtige individuelle Gehaltsanalyse. Auch in Gesprächen mit der Familie und guten Freunden kann sich Offenheit in Gehaltsfragen auszahlen. Allerdings ist es selbst im privaten Rahmen häufig nicht üblich, detailliert über den Verdienst zu sprechen, und unter Umständen stoßen Sie auf ein gewisses Be- fremden hinsichtlich Ihrer ungewohnten Offenheit. Im Kollegenkreis ist es aber auf jeden Fall besser, diskret zu bleiben. Der Arbeitgeber sieht Kollegenabsprachen alles andere als gern, zudem ist in manchem Arbeitsvertrag Verschwiegenheit ver- einbart.

then 81 Mythos 9: Hauptsache verbeamtet Beamte haben mit vielen Vorurteilen zu kämpfen, worunter das der Trägheit noch zu den geringsten gehört. Vor allem geht es ihnen angeblich zu gut. Verglichen mit ihrem eigenen Lebens- standard, Einkommen und ihren Rentenaussichten, wecken die Vorzüge des Beamtentums den Neid der Angestellten in der Pri- vatwirtschaft. Dabei mussten die Beamten in den vergangenen Jahren einige Abstriche in Kauf nehmen. Die Vorzüge des Beamtentums Doch zunächst zu den unbestritten guten Seiten des Beamtenda- seins: Die Jobsicherheit Beamte müssen niemals um ihren Job ban- gen, wenn es der Wirtschaft nicht so gut geht. Selbst wenn ihre Dienstherren Verluste machen, ist Beamten ihre Position sicher. Sie können nicht gekündigt werden. Es gibt allerdings einige Ausnahmen: Wird ein Beamter straf- fällig, kann er nicht nur seinen Job, sondern auch den Beamtensta- tus verlieren. Beamte auf Zeit müssen sich nach ihren vereinbar- ten Dienstjahren nach einer neuen Beschäftigung umsehen, und Beamte auf Probe können nach der Probezeit abgelehnt werden. Netto bleibt mehr übrig Beamte zahlen keine Sozialversiche- rungsbeiträge.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Rest begleichen sie in der Regel durch die Mitgliedschaft in einer privaten Krankenversicherung. Hohe Pensionen Beamte zahlen auch nicht in die gesetzliche Rentenversicherung ein. Nach ihrem Ausscheiden aus dem Dienst erhalten sie eine Pension, die etwas mehr als 70 Prozent des letz- ten Gehalts beträgt und von ihnen versteuert werden muss. Auch Hinterbliebene eines verstorbenen Beamten sind abgesichert und erhalten Witwen- bzw. Waisengeld. Die durchschnittliche monatliche Pension der Beamten und Richter liegt monatlich bei 2 620 Euro (West) beziehungsweise 1 780 Euro (Ost).

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Daneben gibt es die Besoldungsgruppe B für die Spitzenbe- amten, die Besoldungsgruppe R für Richter und die Besoldungs- gruppe W für die Professoren an Hochschulen. Die guten Zeiten sind vorbei In den vergangenen Jahren hat sich für die Beamten viel verändert. Mehrere Reformen führten dazu, dass sie mehr arbeiten müssen, sich ihr Aufstieg stärker an Leistung orientiert und ihre Pensionen weniger üppig ausfallen werden als früher. Überdurchschnittlich lange Arbeitszeiten Den Vorwurf der Trägheit müssen sich Beamte nicht gefallen lassen. Ihre Arbeitszei- ten sind überdurchschnittlich lang. Beamte beim Bund haben eine Wochenarbeitszeit von 41 Stunden, in manchen Bundesländern wie Bayern und Hessen sind es sogar 42 Stunden.

then 85 Das Leistungsprinzip Nicht nur in der Privatwirtschaft wird zu- nehmend die individuelle Leistung der Mitarbeiter durch Einmal- zahlungen und Prämien honoriert. Das Leistungsprinzip hat inzwi- schen auch in den Behörden Einzug gehalten. Für gute Beamte gibt es Leistungsprämien und -zulagen. Die Prämie wird einmalig gezahlt, sie richtet sich nach der Besoldungsgruppe und kann beispielsweise im höheren Dienst in der Gruppe A13 maximal 3 106 Euro betra- gen. Die Leistungszulage wird monatlich gezahlt, sie kann höchs- tens 7 Prozent der Prämie betragen. Wer dauerhaft überzeugt, kann schneller in die nächsthöhere Gehaltsstufe aufrücken. Umgekehrt geht es aber genauso: Wer den Leistungsanforderungen nicht gerecht wird, wird nicht automatisch in die nächsthöhere Gehaltsstufe ver- setzt. Der Aufstieg erfolgt erst dann, wenn die Leistung passt. Auch Beamte in der Probezeit werden stärker nach ihrer Leis- tung bemessen. Genügen sie den Anforderungen nicht, gibt es keine Übernahme in den Staatsdienst. Einschnitte bei den Pensionen Verglichen mit der durchschnitt- lichen Rente – 718,20 Euro – sind die Durchschnittspensionen der Beamten mit 2 620 Euro (West) und 1 780 Euro (Ost) üppig. Dennoch mussten die Beamten durch mehrere Reformen seit 1992 Abstriche hinnehmen. Wer regulär nach 40 Jahren aus dem Dienst ausscheidet, erhält 6,5 Prozent weniger, wer freiwillig vorzeitig ausscheidet 13 Prozent weniger als vor den Reformen. Starke Ein- schnitte gibt es im Fall der Dienstunfähigkeit: Hier muss man mit Einbußen bis zu 32 Prozent rechnen.

then 87 steiger, die im richtigen Beruf in der richtigen Branche die große Karriere machen. Wer schafft es nach oben? Beim Thema Reichtum sind die Deutschen skeptisch. Die meisten glauben nicht, dass man mit eigener ehrlicher Arbeit ein Vermö- gen anhäufen kann. Vielmehr sind sie überzeugt, dass man über gute Ausgangsbedingungen und Beziehungen verfügen muss, um nach oben zu kommen. Tatsächlich werden in Deutschland die Bildungschancen und die spätere berufliche Laufbahn stark von der sozialen Herkunft beeinflusst. Das zeigen mehrere Studien, darunter die Schulstu- die Pisa, die Sozialerhebung des Deutschen Studentenwerks und auch der Armuts- und Reichtumsbericht der Bundesregierung. So nehmen 83 Prozent der Kinder eines Akademiker-Vaters ein Stu- dium auf, dagegen nur 23 Prozent der Kinder, deren Vater nicht studiert hat. Der Eliteforscher Michael Hartmann von der Technischen Uni- versität Darmstadt betont, dass es auch später im Berufsleben starke Selektionsmechanismen gibt. Die Elite rekrutiert sich aus sich selbst. »Wir sind keine Fahrstuhlgesellschaft, in der es für die meisten nach oben geht, wie es in den 80er Jahren des vergange- nen Jahrhunderts manchmal noch hieß. Zum Manager wird man geboren«, sagte Hartmann in einem Interview mit dem Magazin Stern .

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! üblich, dass über Monate hinweg Tag und Nacht und oftmals an den Wochenenden hindurch gearbeitet wird, ohne zu wissen, ob sich der Einsatz am Ende auch wirklich rentiert«, bemerkt Uder. Zu den Berufsgruppen, die zurzeit besonders nachgefragt sind, gehören beispielsweise die Finanzplaner, die die Lebens- und Ver- mögenssituation ihrer Kunden analysieren und dann individuell zugeschnittene Finanzprodukte anbieten. Viele Banker zieht es auch ins Ausland, wo teils noch höhere Gehälter gezahlt werden. Investmentbanker gehen nach London und New York, wo die Banken jährlich Milliarden an Bonuszah- lungen ausschütten. Bei Investmentbankern nimmt das Grund- gehalt nur einen geringen Anteil an der gesamten Vergütung ein. »Hier gilt das Prinzip des Profit-Sharing. Zwischen 0,5 und 40 Prozent des Profits wird an die Banker ausgeschüttet, wobei sich der persönliche Anteil an individuellen Erfolgskomponenten bemisst«, sagt Uder. Tipp: Wenn das Gehalt für Sie eine große Rolle spielt, sollten Sie diesen Faktor schon bei der Wahl Ihrer Ausbildung berücksichtigen. Investieren Sie schon während der Ausbildung für den späteren Berufseinstieg. In der Finanzbranche beispielsweise werden von Hochschulabsolventen neben Fremdsprachen auch Auslandserfah- rung und berufsrelevante Praktika erwartet. Wer eine gut bezahlte Karriere anstrebt, muss sich aber auch darüber im Klaren sein, dass seine Arbeitszeiten auf Dauer deutlich überdurchschnittlich sein werden.

»Ich wollte nicht arm sein, aber reich? Bei meiner Berufswahl habe ich mich nicht daran orientiert.« Theo Waigel, Politiker Es gibt viele Gründe, warum das eigene Gehalt vergleichsweise niedrig liegt. Meist ist die Wahl der Ausbildungsrichtung und eines Berufes schuld, der von vornherein wenig Aussicht auf Aufstiegs- und höhere Verdienstchancen bietet. Das gilt vor allem, aber nicht nur, für die typischen Frauenberufe. Manche schlagen auch nach dem Studium den Weg des niedrigen Entgelts ein, weil sie eine Tä- tigkeit oder eine Branche wählen, die vom Gehaltsaspekt her wenig lohnend ist – in Kulturjobs etwa wird in der Regel weniger gezahlt als in der IT-Branche. Und einem freiberuflichen Übersetzer hilft es wenig, neidisch auf die Verdienstmöglichkeiten eines SAP-Beraters zu schielen.

Und nicht wenige haben einen ordentlichen Job ergattert und führen dann das Dasein eines Mauerblümchens, in der Erwar- tung, dass ihnen der Chef endlich mehr Gehalt anbietet. Und dann gibt es noch diejenigen, die in einer beschaulichen Kleinstadt arbei- ten und mit großen Augen über das Gehaltsgefüge in der Banken- metropole Frankfurt staunen. Wie immer im Leben kommt es auch beim Gehalt darauf an, mit wem man sich vergleicht, was man wirklich will und was man dafür tut (oder zu tun bereit ist).

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Schlecht bezahlte Berufe Viele Aspekte spielen bei der Wahl eines Berufes mit, und schön ist es, wenn der Berufswunsch von Interesse und Idealismus ge- leitet wird. Doch sollten keinesfalls Ahnungs- und Planlosigkeit die Basis einer Karriere sein: In manchen Berufen lässt sich nun einmal nicht viel verdienen. Dennoch werden sie von vielen an- gestrebt, manchmal aus Idealismus, manchmal aus schlichtem Unwissen. Ausbildung mit mageren Aussichten Die Rede ist nicht von Aushilfsjobs, die von ungelernten Arbeits- kräften ausgeübt werden, die keine anderen Möglichkeiten haben, ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen. Gemeint sind Ausbildungen, die mit einem Gehalt vergütet werden, das kaum zum Überleben reicht.

Zu den bekanntesten Beispielen gehört der Friseurberuf, der zu unrühmlicher Bekanntheit in der Debatte um die Einfüh- rung eines Mindestlohns in Deutschland gekommen ist.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Auch nach der Ausbildung ist Bescheidenheit angesagt. Dann verdienen Friseure zum Beispiel in Nordrhein-Westfalen zwischen 1 129 und 1 173 Euro brutto im Monat. In Sachsen gibt es noch weniger, nur 615 bis 755 Euro. Große Gehaltssprünge im Lauf der Karriere gibt es nicht, wie die Daten der Umfrage lohnspiegel. de zeigen: Selbst mit zehnjähriger Berufserfahrung und Leitungs- funktion kommen die befragten Friseure im Schnitt auf ein Grundgehalt von gerade 1 223 Euro brutto monatlich (West) be- ziehungsweise 795 Euro (Ost). Das entspricht einem Bruttostun- denlohn von 7,43 beziehungsweise 4,83 Euro. Eine ähnliche magere Karriere haben die angehenden Arzt- helfer vor sich, deren offizielle Berufsbezeichnung heute »me- dizinische Fachangestellte« lautet. Auch sie werden während der Ausbildung unterdurchschnittlich bezahlt: Über alle drei Lehrjahre gerechnet kommen sie auf 522 Euro brutto monat- lich. Als Berufsanfänger können sie laut Tarifvertrag mit 1 356 Euro brutto rechnen. Mit zehn Jahren Berufserfahrung und Leitungsaufgaben steigt ihr monatliches Einkommen auf 1 765 Euro (West) beziehungsweise 1 249 Euro (Ost), so die Angaben aus der Gehaltsumfrage lohnspiegel.de, Urlaubsgeld und Zulagen sind nicht eingerechnet. Große Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten gibt es in diesem Beruf nicht. Auch die Krankenhäuser bieten für harte Arbeit vergleichsweise bescheidenen Lohn. Krankenschwestern und -pfleger verdienen ab 2 000 Euro brutto monatlich. Ähnlich liegen die Verdienst- möglichkeiten in Altenheimen: Altenpfleger kommen in westdeut- schen kommunalen Pflegeheimen auf ein Gehalt ab 1 700 Euro monatlich. Nicht nur im Gesundheitssektor brauchen viele Beschäftigte eine große Portion Idealismus, um die schlechte Bezahlung weg- zustecken.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Aber nicht nur in den typischen Frauenberufen gibt es wenig Geld. Ein Wunsch vieler kleiner Jungen ist es, Lokführer zu wer- den. Wer seinen Traum später umsetzt, wird im Leben keine gro- ßen Sprünge machen können. Lokführer verdienen nach Anga- ben der Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer als Anfänger monatlich etwa 1 550 Euro netto. Und diese Anlerntätigkeit ist eine berufliche Sackgasse, weitere Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten existieren nicht. Nach 25 Jahren Berufserfahrung beträgt der Verdienst 1850 Euro netto. Lohnender wäre es, seinen Wunsch, große Verkehrsmaschinen zu führen, mit einer Pilotenausbil- dung zu verwirklichen. Die kostet zwar ordentlich (zwischen 50 000 und 100 000 Euro), doch dafür verdienen Piloten gut: Je nach Fluggesellschaft gibt es beim Einstieg zwischen 2 000 und 4 000 Euro monatlich, als Flugkapitän etwa ab 6 000 Euro pro Monat. Noch magerer als für Lokführer sieht es für die Zugbe- gleiter aus: Sie kommen auf lediglich 1 763 bis 1 815 Euro. Einen falschen Eindruck vermitteln mitunter die Ausbildungs- gehälter. So schneiden zum Beispiel Straßenbauer und Maurer im Berufsvergleich überdurchschnittlich ab. Sie erhalten während der Lehre 859 Euro – und damit fast das Doppelte der angehenden Friseure. Doch nach zehn Jahren im Beruf verdient ein Maurer nur 2 335 Euro brutto, ein Straßenbauer, der andere anleitet, im- merhin 2 738 Euro. Tipp: Vor der Berufswahl: Sammeln Sie so viele Informationen wie möglich und sprechen Sie auf jeden Fall mit Älteren, die bereits in Ihrem Wunschberuf arbeiten. Die Arbeitsagenturen bieten auch Tests an, anhand derer man prüfen kann, welcher Beruf zu den eigenen Neigungen und Fähigkeiten passen könnte.

f allen 99 Akademiker: Bettel- oder Starabsolvent? Auch ein Studium schützt nicht vor einem geringen Gehalt. Arbeitsmarktexperten betonen, dass sich ein Studium lohnt, da Hochschulabsolventen verglichen mit Beschäftigten anderer Aus- bildung das geringste Risiko haben, einmal arbeitslos zu werden. Doch wie bereits in dem Kapitel zum Gehaltsmythos »Akade- miker verdienen mehr« ausgeführt wurde, ist es eine Frage der Fächerwahl, ob sich ein Studium auch auszahlt. Akademiker spalten sich in Star- und Bettelabsolventen. Bei man- chen Fachrichtungen ist ein gutes, wenn nicht gar sehr gutes Gehalt schon vorgezeichnet. Das gilt zum Beispiel für die Ingenieure und Informatikexperten. Andere müssen schauen, dass sie überhaupt einen Job bekommen. Bei ihnen ist die Gehaltsfrage verständlicher- weise zweitrangig und häufig Anlass zur Genügsamkeit. In einigen Branchen und unter einigen Fachrichtungen ist in den vergangenen Jahren geradezu ein akademisches Prekariat mit unsicheren Arbeitsverhältnissen entstanden: Für die Absolventen gibt es immer weniger unbefristete Festanstellungen in Vollzeit. Stattdessen bestimmen Tätigkeiten auf Honorarbasis und befris- tete Jobs ihren Berufseinstieg, vor allem bei Geistes- und Sozial- wissenschaftlern. Eine gute Anlaufstelle mit weiterführenden Links ist zum Bei- spiel www.berufenet.de, ein Internetangebot der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. Unter www.bibb.de kann man leicht die Ausbildungsvergü- tungen nachschlagen. Natürlich sollte das Gehalt nicht das einzige Kriterium bei der Berufswahl sein. Der Job soll ja auch Spaß machen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Wie Hochschulabsolventen, die 2005 ihr Examen gemacht haben, auf dem Arbeitsmarkt untergekommen sind, zeigt eine bundesweite Befragung des Hochschul-Informations-Systems (HIS) im Auftrag des Bundesbildungsministeriums. Direkt nach dem Studium hatten beispielsweise nur 14 Prozent der Sprach- und Kulturwissenschaftler eine unbefristete Vollzeitstelle. Bei den Informatikern waren es 70 Prozent, bei den Wirtschaftswissen- schaftlern immerhin 49 Prozent. Selbst eineinhalb Jahre nach dem Examen arbeiteten nur 18 Prozent der Sprach- und Kulturwissenschaftler in einem un- befristeten Vollzeitjob. Die unsicheren Beschäftigungsverhält- nisse wirken sich auch auf das Einkommen aus, die Akademiker müssen Abstriche bei ihren Gehaltsvorstellungen machen. Ein- einhalb Jahre nach dem Examen verfügen Sprach- und Kultur- wissenschaftler über ein im Fächervergleich deutlich unterdurch- schnittliches Bruttojahreseinkommen von 25 950 Euro, wogegen das durchschnittliche Einkommen der Uni-Absolventen bei 30 650 Euro liegt. Die Beschäftigungsunsicherheit setzt sich auch mit zunehmen- der Berufserfahrung fort. Das zeigt eine Befragung der Freien Universität Berlin, die im Jahr 2007 den Berufseinstieg von Hoch- schulabsolventen untersucht hat, die 2002 ihr Studium in Berlin und Nordrhein-Westfalen abgeschlossen hatten. Über alle Fächer hinweg arbeiten 16 Prozent der Befragten freiberuflich und als Selbstständige.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! hören seit Jahren die Architekten. Ihr Jahreseinkommen ist mit 22 850 Euro brutto eineinhalb Jahre nach Studienende im Fächer- vergleich das niedrigste überhaupt. Junge Architekten schlagen sich häufig mit Honorartätigkeiten durch. Einen unbefristeten Vollzeit- job haben eineinhalb Jahre nach dem Examen nur 25 Prozent, wie die HIS-Befragung ergab. Nach einer – allerdings unverbindlichen – Gehaltsempfehlung des Arbeitgeberverbands Deutscher Architekten und Ingenieure erhalten junge Architekten in größeren Städten ein Monatsgehalt von 2 620 Euro brutto im ersten Berufsjahr. Generation Praktikum Selbst unter den Praktikanten wird klar, wer Star-, wer Bettelab- solvent ist – die unterschiedlichen Berufschancen der Akademiker spiegeln sich hier wider. In manchen Bereichen müssen Praktika häufig unentgeltlich geleistet werden, anderswo gibt es monatlich Tipp: Informieren Sie sich bereits vor der Studienwahl, was nach dem Examen auf Sie zukommt. Es gilt dasselbe wie vor der Wahl eines Aus- bildungsberufs: Sprechen Sie mit Älteren, die bereits Berufserfah- rung haben, machen Sie Praktika. Versuchen Sie bereits während des Studiums, die berufliche Wirklichkeit in möglichst verschiedenen Be- reichen kennenzulernen. Es gibt auch für Geisteswissenschaftler gut bezahlte Jobs. Wenn Sie aber lieber Schriftsteller werden möchten, werden Sie Schriftsteller. Geld hin oder her – das Wichtigste ist es, ein Studienfach zu wählen, das einem Spaß macht. Schließlich be- gleitet einen der Beruf meist ein Leben lang.

Insgesamt machen der bundeswei- ten HIS-Befragung zufolge nur 15 Prozent der Uni-Absolventen nach dem Examen ein Praktikum. Überdurchschnittlich häufig entscheiden sich jedoch Architekten, Sprach- und Kulturwissen- schaftler, Psychologen, Biologen und auch Wirtschaftswissen- schaftler dafür. Die Absolventenbefragung der FU Berlin unter Akademikern, die 2002 ihr Examen in Berlin und Nordrhein-Westfalen mach- ten, liefert einen Fächervergleich: Bei den bezahlten Praktika lag die durchschnittliche monatliche Vergütung bei 599 Euro brutto monatlich, bei den Geisteswissenschaftlern aber nur bei 485 Euro. Im Branchenvergleich schnitten Industrie, Handel, Banken und Versicherungen am besten ab. Hier erhielt jeder Vierte sogar mehr als 1 000 Euro brutto monatlich. In den Medien, wo viele Geis- teswissenschaftler ihren Berufseinstieg suchen, war dagegen gut jedes zweite Praktikum unentgeltlich. Nach einer Umfrage des Bundesarbeitsministeriums aus dem Jahr 2008 – befragt wurden junge Erwerbstätige zwischen 18 und 34 mit abgeschlossener Berufsausbildung – war die Hälfte der absolvierten Erstpraktika unbezahlt und 12 Prozent waren unangemessen vergütet. 30 Prozent der Befragten gaben an, sich während des Praktikums ausgenützt gefühlt zu haben. Geplant ist jetzt eine gesetzliche Klarstellung, um unbezahlte Praktika zu verbieten und den Lernzweck zu betonen. Von Gewerkschaften wurde eine monatliche Vergütung von 300 Euro für Studierende und 600 Euro für Hochschulabsolventen vorgeschlagen. Tipp: Praktika während des Studiums machen Sinn. Doch nach dem Examen muss irgendwann Schluss damit sein. Wenn Sie Praktika an Praktika hängen, verkaufen Sie sich nur auf Dauer unter Wert.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Arme Künstler Kunstschaffende benötigen nicht nur großes Talent, sondern auch Bescheidenheit. Das spüren schon die Beschäftigten, die in künst- lerisch-handwerklichen Berufen arbeiten. Zum Alltag von Goldschmieden gehört der Umgang mit Gold und Juwelen. Doch selbst könnten sie sich die Kostbarkeiten kaum leisten. Wenn sie ihre Ausbildung in einem Handwerksbetrieb machen, erhalten sie zwischen 205 Euro im ersten und 310 Euro im vierten Lehrjahr monatlich. (In der Schmuck-Industrie gibt es mehr, nämlich zwischen 801 und 867 Euro monatlich.) Nach ab- geschlossener Lehre verdienen sie ab 2 000 Euro. Ein anderes Beispiel sind Orchestermusiker: Wer es so weit bringt, muss nicht nur viel Talent haben, sondern auch jahrelang hart an seinem Können üben. Finanziell rentiert sich das für die wenigen, die eine Solistenkarriere verwirklichen können. Der normale Orchestermusiker dagegen kommt nach der Ausbildung in einem Orchester mittlerer Größe (mit 66 Stellen) auf etwa Hochschulabschluss nicht gut. Wer einen schweren Start auf dem Arbeitsmarkt hat, kann es mit freiberuflicher Arbeit versuchen. Eine Alternative ist auch die Zeitarbeit, die zwar in der Regel nicht so gut bezahlt ist wie ein regulärer Job, aber deutlich besser als die meisten Praktika. Viele Zeitarbeiter setzen darauf, von dem Unternehmen, in dem sie befristet eingesetzt werden, übernommen zu werden. Das gelingt zwar den wenigsten, aber die gut Qualifizierten haben etwas höhere Chancen. Einen Versuch ist es allemal wert.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Das liegt auch daran, dass es Festanstellungen in der Branche kaum gibt. Ob Schauspieler, Kameramann oder Regisseur: Die Beschäftigten hangeln sich von Auftrag zu Auftrag, in den Pau- sen dazwischen verdienen sie nichts. Entsprechend unsicher ist ihre soziale Absicherung. Wie eine Umfrage der Gewerkschaft ver.di zeigt, haben zwei Drittel der Film- und Fernsehschaf- fenden höchstens vier Produktionen im Jahr. Bei einem Drittel der Befragten dauerte das letzte Engagement zwischen 20 und 40 Tagen, bei knapp einem Viertel weniger. Auch Tagesengage- ments sind in der Branche üblich. So relativieren sich schnell die für Festangestellte üppig wirkenden Wochengagen, wie sie im Tarifvertrag für auf Produktionsdauer beschäftigte Film- und Fernsehschaffende vorgesehen sind. Demnach kommt zum Bei- spiel ein Kameramann auf 2 440 Euro wöchentlich, ein Produk- tionsleiter auf 1 500 Euro und ein Tonassistent auf 910 Euro. Die Arbeitsbedingungen während der Produktionen sind hart, für mehr als die Hälfte sind Arbeitstage von 12 bis 14 Stunden üblich. Schauspieler handeln ihre Gagen frei aus. Für einen Drehtag gibt es etwa 1 000 Euro für einen Schauspieler ohne größeren Bekanntheitsgrad – bei Vermittlung durch einen Agenten geht dessen Beteiligung noch ab. Nur die wenigen Darsteller mit be- kannteren Namen streichen deutlich höhere Gagen ein. Damit erhalten sie an wenigen Tagen mehr, als sie am Theater im Monat verdienen können. Bei Festanstellungen liegt das Min- destgehalt an deutschen Bühnen bei 1 550 Euro brutto monat- lich. Alles, was darüber hinausgeht, ist Verhandlungssache. An kleineren Bühnen verdienen Berufseinsteiger um die 2 000 Euro, an größeren Theatern können es etwa 3 000 Euro sein.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Niedriglohn und Mindestlohn In Deutschland verdienen viele Beschäftigte deutlich unterdurch- schnittlich. Für Tätigkeiten für so wenig Geld gibt es den Begriff »Niedriglohnsektor«, der unterschiedlich definiert wird. Das In- stitut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (IAB) spricht von einem Niedriglohn, wenn er unter zwei Drittel des Durchschnittslohns aller Vollzeitbeschäftigten liegt. Damit liegt die Niedriglohnschwelle bei 1 779 Euro brutto (West) beziehungsweise 1 323 Euro (Ost). Jeder sechste Vollzeitbeschäftigte ist nach dieser Definition Niedriglöhner. Der Großteil muss auf Dauer mit dem geringen Verdienst auskommen, denn in einen besser bezahlten Job auf- zusteigen schaffen die wenigsten. Das IAB untersuchte die Ein- kommensentwicklung der Geringverdiener über einen Zeitraum von sechs Jahren: Am Ende verdiente nur jeder Achte der unter- suchten Beschäftigten über Niedriglohnniveau. Das Risiko, für so wenig Geld zu arbeiten, ist nicht auf un- Tipp: Es ist schwierig, einem künstlerisch veranlagten Menschen einen guten Rat zu geben, wenn es um die späteren Einkommens- möglichkeiten geht. Soll er etwa wegen magerer Durchschnittsver- dienste sein Talent verschwenden? Außerdem wird ihn der finanzielle Aspekt womöglich wenig interessieren, geht er doch eher idealistisch an seine Karriere heran. Mancher wird im Lauf seines Berufslebens pragmatisch und arbeitet, eigentlich Regisseur oder Schauspieler, nebenher als Heilpraktiker oder als Handwerker. Also kann der Rat nur lauten (wenn überhaupt einer gewünscht wird): gut informieren, wissen, worauf man sich einlässt, netzwerken, um an möglichst viele Jobs zu kommen, und: notfalls zweigleisig

f allen 109 gelernte Hilfsarbeiter beschränkt, sondern drei Viertel der Nied- riglöhner haben eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung oder einen Hochschulabschluss. Niedriglöhne werden in vielen Branchen gezahlt. Am häu- figsten kommen sie im Dienstleistungsbereich vor, vor allem im Hotel- und Gaststättengewerbe, im Einzelhandel und bei per- sonenbezogenen Dienstleistungen. Der Beruf mit dem höchsten Niedriglohn-Risiko ist der des Friseurs, so beträgt die unterste Lohngrenze in Bayern 1 067 Euro. Auch Zeitarbeiter sind über- durchschnittlich häufig davon betroffen. Selbst in Branchen, in denen Tarifverträge gelten, gibt es Nied- riglöhner. Das heißt nicht, dass alle dort Beschäftigten so wenig verdienen. Aber die untersten Tarife sind Niedriglöhne. Dazu zählt zum Beispiel das Bewachungsgewerbe, also private Sicher- heitsfirmen. Ein Angestellter kommt in Brandenburg bei einer 40-Stunden-Woche auf mindestens 1 200 Euro brutto, in Bayern sind es bei einer 38-Stunden-Woche 1 701 Euro. Für Floristen liegt der unterste Tariflohn in Bayern sogar bei nur 1 007 Euro, bei Dachdeckern bundesweit bei 1 035 Euro. Schlecht bezahlte Jobs, bei denen das Einkommen der Beschäf- tigten kaum zum Überleben reicht, haben zur Diskussion um einen Mindestlohn geführt: Ein bestimmtes Lohnniveau wird per Gesetz als verbindliche Untergrenze festgeschrieben; schlechter darf kein Beschäftigter entlohnt werden. In 20 Mitgliedsländern der Europäischen Union gibt es bereits einen Mindestlohn. In Deutschland wird ein Stundenlohn von 7,50 Euro brutto dis- kutiert. Bei einer 40-Stunden-Woche entspricht das etwa einem Bruttomonatsgehalt von 1 300 Euro. Manche Niedriglöhner leben trotz ihres Vollzeitjobs in Armut, vor allem dann, wenn der Lebensunterhalt ausschließlich vom Niedriglohn-Job bestritten werden muss.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Fast 500 000 Vollzeitbeschäftigte beziehen aus diesem Grund ergänzend zu ihrem Einkommen aus Erwerbstätigkeit die staat- liche Leistung »Grundsicherung«. Zeitarbeit: Weniger Geld für den gleichen Job Die Zeitarbeitsbranche boomt seit Jahren. Die Zahl der Zeit- arbeiter hat sich in den vergangenen zwölf Jahren vervierfacht: von 165 000 auf heute mehr als 700 000. Ungefähr 2 Prozent aller Beschäftigten in Deutschland sind bei einer Zeitarbeitsfirma an- gestellt. Sie werden von ihrem Arbeitgeber an andere Unternehmen ver- liehen, die damit kurzfristigen Personalbedarf decken, Projekte organisieren oder ihre Arbeitskosten senken.

Daneben werden vor allem qualifizierte Tätigkeiten vermittelt: Jobs für Mechaniker, Sekretärinnen oder Arzthelferinnen. Hoch qualifi- zierte Tätigkeiten spielen bislang zwar eine untergeordnete Rolle, aber es gibt auch Ingenieure, Ärzte und Journalisten, die auf Zeit vermittelt werden. Nach Angaben der Bundesagentur für Arbeit nehmen die Jobangebote von Zeitarbeitsfirmen für junge Hoch- schulabsolventen deutlich zu. Gefragt sind vor allem Dolmetscher und Übersetzer, Sozialarbeiter, Chemiker, Betriebswirte, IT-Fach- leute, Grafiker und Ingenieure.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Für Facharbeiten, die eine Ausbildung oder entsprechende Berufs- erfahrung voraussetzen, beträgt der Tarif zwischen 1 244 und 1 421 Euro. Ihre fest angestellten Kollegen erhalten aber zum Bei- spiel in der Metallindustrie für Hilfstätigkeiten einen Tariflohn von 1 799 Euro, für Facharbeiten von 2 021 Euro. Mit solchen Löhnen fallen die Zeitarbeiter bereits in den Niedriglohnsektor. Nach einer Studie des Instituts für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsfor- schung sind tatsächlich 70 Prozent der Zeitarbeiter Niedriglohn- empfänger. Billiger arbeiten als andere – für manche Zeitarbeiter wird das zum Dauerzustand. Die Hoffnung vieler Zeitarbeiter ist es, in dem Betrieb, in den sie verliehen werden, übernommen zu wer- den. Schließlich waren viele vor der Zeitarbeit arbeitslos. Doch manche bleiben auf Jahre bei ihrem Verleiher angestellt. Nach einer Studie des Instituts für Arbeits- und Berufsforschung (IAB) in Nürnberg sind etwa 13 Prozent der Arbeitnehmer mindestens ein Jahr bei derselben Zeitarbeitsfirma beschäftigt. Ein neuer Trend verstärkt die Gefahr, auf Dauer Billigarbeiter zu bleiben: Einige Unternehmen haben inzwischen selbst Leih- arbeitsfirmen gegründet, über die sie ihre eigenen Mitarbeiter an sich verleihen – und dadurch auch schlechter bezahlen können. Die Gewerkschaften setzen sich zunehmend für Zeitarbeiter ein. So hat die IG Metall 2008 gegen die Ungleichbehandlung von Leiharbeitern die Kampagne »Gleiches Geld für gleiche Arbeit« geführt, deren Ziel es ist, gleiche Bezahlung für Zeitarbeiter und Festangestellte zu erreichen. Allein in der Metall- und Elektro- industrie arbeiten 260 000 Zeitarbeiter. Beim Autokonzern BMW konnte die Gewerkschaft ihre Vor- stellungen im Jahr 2008 verwirklichen. Hier wurden tatsächlich die Leiharbeiter bessergestellt und werden nun nicht mehr nach den Tarifverträgen der Zeitarbeitsfirmen, sondern nach dem Ta- rifvertrag der Metall- und Elektroindustrie bezahlt.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! der niedrigste Stundenlohn bei 7,43 Euro, sind es jetzt 11,61 Euro bis 28,17 Euro. Für den einzelnen Leiharbeiter bedeutet das eine Lohnsteigerung von bis zu 56 Prozent, in den untersten Lohn- gruppen macht die Umstellung ein monatliches Plus von 600 Euro brutto aus. Ganz sind die Leiharbeiter den Festangestellten jedoch immer noch nicht gleichgestellt: Sie erhalten keine übertariflichen Zulagen und auch keine Gewinnbeteiligung. Elternzeit mit Nebenwirkungen Ein Kind ist unbezahlbar. Eltern wägen finanzielle Abstriche, die sie wegen ihres Nachwuchses machen müssen, nicht ab. Aber na- türlich ärgert es sie, wenn sie sich ungerecht behandelt fühlen. In beruflicher Hinsicht traf das bislang vor allem auf Mütter zu. Sie sind mit der Schwangerschaft und der Kindererziehung beruflich ins Hintertreffen geraten, was sich auch auf die Verdienstmöglich- keiten und ihre soziale Absicherung im Fall von Arbeitslosigkeit und später bei der Rente auswirkte. Bezahlte Auszeit Wer heute ein Kind bekommt, kann Elternzeit nehmen und Elterngeld beantragen. Die staatliche Förderung soll den Ein- kommensausfall auffangen, wenn sich ein Elternteil beruflich zurückzieht, um für das Kind da zu sein. Mutter oder Vater kön- nen höchstens bis zum ersten Lebensjahr des Kindes Elterngeld beziehen, wechseln sie sich in der Betreuung ab, verlängert sich die Bezugsdauer auf insgesamt 14 Monate.

f allen 115 es auch, sich nicht ganz aus dem Beruf zurückzuziehen, sondern nur weniger zu arbeiten. Darauf besteht für mindestens zwei Monate ein Anspruch, erlaubt sind dann maximal 30 Stunden pro Woche. Die Höhe des Elterngelds orientiert sich bei Berufstätigen am Gehalt: Gezahlt werden 67 Prozent des Nettoeinkommens, das in den letzten zwölf Monaten vor Geburt des Kindes erreicht wurde – mindestens 300, höchstens 1 800 Euro monatlich. Den Höchstbetrag erhalten nur sehr wenige Eltern. Mehr als die Hälfte bekommt weniger als 500 Euro monatlich, nur 15 Prozent erhalten mehr als 1 000 Euro. Während der Elternzeit besteht ein besonderer Kündigungs- schutz. Bei Müttern bereits ab der Schwangerschaft, bei Vätern setzt er acht Wochen vor Beginn der Elternzeit ein. Papa arbeitet, Mama kocht Die erste Zeit nach der Geburt eines Kindes ist also abgesichert. Aber die große Frage für viele Eltern ist: Wie geht es nach der Familienpause weiter? Eltern haben die Möglichkeit, insgesamt drei Jahre Erziehungs- urlaub zu nehmen. Davon machten bislang vor allem die Müt- ter Gebrauch. Im Jahr 2003 waren nur 26,5 Prozent der Frauen mit einem Kind unter drei Jahren berufstätig, in Ostdeutschland waren es 32,4 Prozent. Die meisten der berufstätigen Mütter arbeiteten in Teilzeit. Ein Teilzeitjob, um Familie und Beruf miteinander zu vereinba- ren, bedeutet nicht nur Abstriche beim Gehalt.

f allen 117 Frühjahr 2008 deutschlandweit 379 Unternehmen verpflichtet, in ihrem Betrieb familienfreundliches Arbeiten zu ermöglichen. Vor allem wollten sie flexiblere Arbeitszeiten anbieten und ihre Mit- arbeiter bei der Kinderbetreuung unterstützen. Reiche Bayern, arme Saarländer Die Ausbildung und der Beruf sind identisch, die Berufserfahrung ist gleich lang, und dennoch sind die Gehälter völlig unterschied- lich: Der Standort des Arbeitgebers kann bei der Bezahlung eine entscheidende Rolle spielen. Das Gehaltsniveau in Deutschland ist von Region zu Region unterschiedlich und kann im Jahr einen Unterschied von ein paar Tausend Euro und mehr ausmachen. Tipp: Sprechen Sie mit Ihrem Partner offen über Ihre Wünsche und Vorstellungen, wie Sie Beruf und Kind miteinander vereinbaren möchten. Nicht jeder möchte Vollzeit weiterarbeiten, anderen fällt es schwer, auf die Karriere und die damit verbundenen Überstunden zu verzichten. Wer beruflich zurücktreten möchte, sollte wissen: Es gibt einen Rechtsanspruch auf Teilzeitarbeit (natürlich für Väter und Mütter). Das schließt nicht aus, nebenher noch mit einem Minijob oder auf selbstständiger Basis etwas dazuzuverdienen. Für das Gehaltsgespräch bietet die Elternschaft einige neue Ver- handlungspunkte, zum Beispiel können Arbeitgeber Zuschüsse zur Kinderbetreuung zahlen. Informieren Sie sich rechtzeitig, was sich steuerlich durch die Elternschaft für Sie ändert, etwa durch Abset- zung von Kinderbetreuungskosten, und lassen Sie die Freibeträge auf Ihrer Steuerkarte

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Hohe Gehälter, hohe Kosten Die höchsten Gehälter werden in den Großstädten München, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main und Köln gezahlt. Dagegen sind die Gehälter in Ostdeutschland und im ländlichen Raum am ge- ringsten (Quelle: Kienbaum). Sogar bei Tarifgehältern gibt es regionale Unterschiede. Tradi- tionell hoch sind die Löhne in Bayern und in Baden-Württemberg, während das Saarland und Rheinland-Pfalz am unteren Ende der Lohnskala stehen. Auch in Ostdeutschland müssen die Tarifbe- schäftigten einen Lohnabzug in Kauf nehmen. Im Schnitt liegt das Gehaltsniveau bei 95 Prozent der westlichen Löhne. Natürlich muss man dabei auch immer die unterschiedlich hohen Lebenshaltungskosten berücksichtigen. In Halle verdient man zwar nicht so viel wie in München, dafür wohnt man dort billiger. Die höchsten Mieten werden in Frankfurt am Main ver- langt. Hier kostet eine 80 Quadratmeter große Dreizimmerwoh- nung durchschnittlich 950 Euro – in Berlin zahlt man für den- selben Wohnraum nur 690 Euro. Die besten Städte für IT-Experten Für Führungskräfte in der Informationstechnologie lohnt es sich am meisten, in Nordrhein-Westfalen zu arbeiten: In Düsseldorf lassen sich 131 000 Euro verdienen, das sind 25 Prozent mehr als der Durchschnittsverdienst in ganz Deutschland für diese Posi- tion. Auch in Köln, Frankfurt, Hamburg und Berlin verdienen IT-Manager überdurchschnittlich, während sie beispielsweise in Hannover und in Nürnberg Abstriche machen müssen.

f allen 119 Auch die Vergütungsberatung Personalmarkt hat in ihrer IT- Gehälterstudie 2008 regionale Unterschiede festgestellt. Die Ge- hälter in Frankfurt am Main liegen demnach 19,3 Prozent über dem Bundesdurchschnitt, in München beträgt der Vorsprung 17,1, in Stuttgart 14,7 Prozent und in Düsseldorf 12,2 Prozent. In Ostdeutschland ist das Gehaltsniveau am niedrigsten: Es erreicht nur 76,5 Prozent des Bundesdurchschnitts. Die regionalen Unterschiede spüren auch die freiberuflichen Computerexperten: Sie können mit einem durchschnittlichen Stundensatz von 73 Euro die höchsten Honorare in Frankfurt am Main verlangen. Es folgen Düsseldorf/Köln/Bonn und der Raum München. In der Region Halle/Leipzig/Dresden liegt der Stundensatz dagegen bei 63 Euro, in Berlin bei 66 Euro (Quelle: IT-Dienstleister Gulp). Gute bezahlte Assistentinnen Auch für Sekretärinnen hat Kienbaum die regionalen Verdienst- unterschiede berechnet. In München, Frankfurt und Hamburg werden die höchsten Gehälter gezahlt. Unterdurchschnittlich sind die Verdienste in Bremen und Berlin und in der Region Dresden/ Leipzig/Halle. Eine Chefsekretärin in Frankfurt am Main ver- dient im Schnitt 57 100 Euro im Jahr, im Ruhrgebiet dagegen nur 49 400 Euro und in Dresden 42100 Euro. Im deutschlandweiten Schnitt kommt sie auf 51 000 Euro.

f allen 121 len mehr Gehalt, tun aber nicht wirklich etwas dafür, stattdessen verfolgen sie eine Vogel-Strauß-Strategie. Typisch dafür ist zum Beispiel, auf seine gute Arbeit zu pochen. Man gibt alles, schiebt die erwarteten und nötigen Überstunden, erfüllt sämtliche Ziele und geht selbstverständlich davon aus, dass der Chef endlich die gute Leistung anerkennt und mit einer Gehaltserhöhung auf einen zukommt. Das wird er nicht. Warum sollte er auch? Er hat einen Mit- arbeiter, der seinen Job gut erfüllt und keine Schwierigkeiten verursacht, also macht er sich um ihn auch keine Gedanken. Pro- bleme hat er schließlich anderswo genug. Er wird spätestens dann aufwachen, wenn ihn sein Muster- Mitarbeiter mit der Tatsache konfrontiert, dass er inzwischen ein lukratives Jobangebot eines anderen Arbeitgebers hat. In der Regel wird er ihn dann mit einer Gehaltserhöhung zu halten ver- suchen. Erstaunlicherweise gehen diesen Schritt nur wenige, die mit ihrem Verdienst unzufrieden sind. Aber Vorsicht: Das kann auch nach hinten losgehen, wenn man nicht wirklich ein anderes Angebot in der Tasche hat oder im Grunde gar nicht wechsel- bereit ist. Und natürlich ist es nicht die einzige Strategie, zu mehr Gehalt zu kommen. Mehr dazu finden Sie im Kapitel »Mehr Ge- halt: die Gehaltsverhandlung«. Eine andere weitverbreitete Haltung ist die, sich mit völlig an- deren Gehaltssphären zu vergleichen, die sich im eigenen Beruf nie erreichen lassen. Das ist reichlich sinnlos. Was bringt es schließlich einer Erzieherin, auf Dauer damit unzufrieden zu sein, dass sie deutlich schlechter bezahlt wird als ein Unternehmensbe- rater? Aus gesellschaftspolitischer Sicht mag sie Recht haben, und die öffentliche Debatte darüber muss sicherlich geführt werden.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Heutzutage kann niemand davon ausgehen, dass er neben sei- nen Monatsgehältern automatisch Weihnachts- und Urlaubsgeld bekommt. Über ein richtiges Weihnachtsgeld können sich nur 57 Prozent aller Beschäftigten in Deutschland freuen. Dafür wer- den immer häufiger Einmalzahlungen vereinbart, die als 13. Ge- halt ausgezahlt werden. Daneben gibt es weitere Gehaltsbestand- teile wie Zuschüsse zu den Fahrtkosten und zur Kinderbetreuung. Das folgende Kapitel gibt Ihnen einen Überblick über die üblichen Gehaltsbestandteile. Einmalzahlung Einmalzahlungen setzen sich in Deutschland zunehmend und quer durch alle Branchen und Positionen durch. Die Beschäftigten erhalten einmal im Jahr ein zusätzliches Gehalt (auch »dreizehn- tes Gehalt« oder Bonus oder auch Prämie genannt), das sowohl von der individuellen Leistung als auch vom Betriebsergebnis abhängig sein kann.

Den Unternehmen erlaubt sie zudem, die Personalkosten an den Unternehmenserfolg zu koppeln: In guten Zeiten profitieren die Mitarbeiter, in mageren Zeiten müssen sie zurückstecken. Vor allem größere Unternehmen beteiligen ihre Mitarbeiter auf diese Art am Gewinn. Je höher die Position, desto höher fällt auch die Gewinnbeteiligung aus.

Außerdem gibt es in Tarifverträgen weitere Zulagen, zum Bei- spiel für bestimmte Funktionen, für erschwerende Arbeitsbedin- gungen und für Mehrarbeit. Monatsgehalt Das ist das Gehalt, das monatlich aufs Konto überwiesen wird. Monatsgehälter sind schlecht miteinander vergleichbar, da zu- sätzliche Gehaltsbestandteile einen großen Teil des Gesamtge- halts ausmachen. Daher sollte man sich immer an Jahresgehältern orientieren. Zusätzlich zum Jahresgehalt können zudem Zusatz- leistungen wie zum Beispiel ein Firmenhandy vereinbart werden. Provision Provisionen werden vor allem im Bereich Vertrieb bezahlt. Die Beschäftigten erhalten dann einen zuvor fest vereinbarten pro- zentualen Anteil an einem Verkauf oder an einem Geschäft, das durch sie abgeschlossen wurde. Ausgleich von Überstunden In Tarifverträgen ist für Mehrarbeit häufig eine Zulage vorgesehen oder der Freizeitausgleich festgeschrieben. Beschäftigte, die keinen Tarifvertrag haben, finden in ihrem Arbeitsvertrag mitunter die Klausel, dass Mehrarbeit mit dem vereinbarten Gehalt abgegolten ist. Das heißt im Klartext: Für Überstunden gibt es nichts – weder\nMehr Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 127 Geld noch Freizeit. Dass Überstunden anfallen werden, davon kann jeder Beschäftigte ausgehen. Pro Jahr leistet jeder Arbeitneh- mer in Deutschland im Schnitt mehr als 50 bezahlte Überstunden, in gleicher Höhe liegen die unbezahlten Überstunden in Deutsch- land. Das hat das Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit berechnet. Urlaubsgeld Das Urlaubsgeld wird einmalig zusätzlich zu den zwölf Monats- gehältern gezahlt.

Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 133 auf die Nase. Sie gehen zum Beispiel mit falschen Vorstellungen in das Gespräch oder bereiten sich nicht ausreichend darauf vor. Im Folgenden werden die zehn typischsten Fehler genannt und er- klärt, warum und wie manche in die Falle tappen, und zeigt, wie es besser geht. Fehler 1: Informationsdefizit Der sicherlich dümmste Fehler, den man machen kann, ist, sich zu wenig vorzubereiten und sich unzureichend zu informieren. Man- che gehen zum Chef nach dem Motto »Allein der Wille zählt«. Doch bei aller Willenskraft sollte man wissen, wo man mit dem eigenen Gehalt steht: Wird man eher unterdurchschnittlich be- zahlt? Oder ist man womöglich mit einem vergleichsweise hohen Gehalt eingestiegen? Wie viel verdienen wohl die Kollegen und wie viel zahlen andere Unternehmen?

Um darauf Antworten zu erhalten, braucht man nicht plötz- lich in der Kantine dem Kollegen auf den Zahn zu fühlen, um »auf Teufel komm raus« dessen Gehalt zu erfahren; die meisten werden sowieso dichthalten. Womöglich haben sie ein gutes Ge- halt ausgehandelt, und der Neid der anderen würde ihnen wenig bringen. Aber auch als »Loser«, der weniger verdient als andere, möchte keiner dastehen – und der Chef sähe solche geheimen Ab- sprachen sicherlich auch nicht gerne. Etwas mühsamer, aber lohnender ist es, sich selbst auf die Suche nach Informationen zu machen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! chen und Positionen: In kostenpflichtigen Gehaltsanalysen bieten Personaldienstleister die Möglichkeit, das eigene Gehalt mit dem von Beschäftigten in ähnlichen Tätigkeiten zu vergleichen (zum Beispiel die Hamburger Beratungsfirma personalmarkt.de und das Münchner Geva-Institut). Allerdings muss man auch bereit sein, sämtliche persönliche Daten preiszugeben. Außerdem ver- öffentlichen Tageszeitungen, Wirtschafts- und Karrieremagazine regelmäßig die neuesten Gehälterstudien. Wichtig ist es dabei auch, sich ein Bild von den Entwicklungs- möglichkeiten zu machen. Wie viel könnte man verdienen, würde man eine verantwortungsvollere Position einnehmen? Und wie viel wäre herauszuholen, wenn man vielleicht eine ähnliche Tätig- keit in einer anderen Branche übernehmen würde? Fehler 2: Egozentrik All die Informationen, die man schließlich beisammen hat, nüt- zen jedoch wenig, wenn man mit dem falschen Standpunkt in die Verhandlung geht. Falsch ist es, nur von sich selbst auszugehen – nach dem Motto: »Ich will mehr Geld. Ich werde vergleichsweise unterdurchschnittlich bezahlt. Also, los geht‘s.« Das reicht nicht, um sein Gegenüber zu überzeugen, und es ist auch eine recht ignorante Haltung. Mehr Gehalt wäre vielleicht angemessen, aber wie könnte der Standpunkt des Chefs dazu sein Tipp: Nehmen Sie sich die Zeit, sich in Ruhe über Gehälter in Ihrem Tätigkeitsfeld und Ihrer Branche zu informieren. Interessant ist auch zu wissen, wie viel Sie in einer anderen Branche verdienen könnten und ob es sich für Sie lohnen würde, sich beruflich in eine bestimmte Richtung weiterzuentwickeln,

Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 135 und warum? Vielleicht gehen die Geschäfte gerade schlecht, dann wäre es wirklich der falsche Zeitpunkt, mehr Gehalt einzufor- dern. Oder dem Chef wurde ein Ausgabenstopp beim Personal- budget verordnet, das heißt er kann dann momentan gar nicht mehr zahlen. Dasselbe gilt, wenn er gar nicht dazu berechtigt ist, selbst Gehaltserhöhungen zu gewähren. Viele Mitarbeiter gehen automatisch davon aus, dass sie mit ihrer Forderung beim nächst- höheren Vorgesetzten beim Richtigen sind. Das stimmt grundsätz- lich auch, doch wenn der Chef selbst gar nicht entscheidungsbe- fugt ist, hilft nur eines: ihn als Verbündeten zu gewinnen, damit er sich an höherer Stelle für einen einsetzt. Auf diese Möglichkeit muss man sich vorbereiten. Auch während des Gesprächs ist es wichtig, sich in die Posi- tion des anderen hineinzuversetzen, um angemessen reagieren zu können: Warum könnte der Chef so antworten und handeln, wie er es tut? Wie könnte man ihn dazu bewegen, auf den eigenen Standpunkt zuzugehen? Fehler 3: Die falschen Argumente Um in der Gehaltsfrage voranzukommen, braucht man Argu- mente, die zählen. Man muss den Vorgesetzten schließlich davon überzeugen, dass eine Gehaltserhöhung richtig ist. Was bewegt einen nun selbst dazu, mehr Gehalt zu fordern? Häufig ist es die eigene finanzielle Situation.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! rer, Nachwuchs kündigt sich an, vielleicht plant man, umzuzie- hen oder gar eine Wohnung oder ein Haus zu kaufen. Doch in der Gehaltsverhandlung hat all das rein gar nichts zu suchen. Kein Chef zahlt einem einzelnen Mitarbeiter mehr, weil die Brotpreise gestiegen sind. Warum zahlt er ihm überhaupt Geld? Damit ihm der Mit- arbeiter im Gegenzug seine Arbeitskraft und seine Leistung zur Verfügung stellt. Das Gehalt soll dieser Leistung angemessen sein. Genau hier muss man mit der Argumentation anfangen: die eigene Leistung. Es gilt, den Chef davon zu überzeugen, dass die eigene Leistung mehr Gehalt wert ist.

Aber auch nach vorne muss man schauen: Was hat man in Zu- kunft vor? Welche Ideen will man noch einbringen? Möchte man vielleicht ein neues Projekt anstoßen?

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! verhandlung gerät, hat er sicher überhaupt nicht gedacht. Viel- leicht hätte auch er sich gerne vorbereitet. Und womöglich hat er gar nicht so viel Zeit, weil er gleich wieder zu einem Termin muss. Grund zum Ärger hat er auf jeden Fall: Sein spontanes Entgegen- kommen wurde aus seiner Sicht ausgenutzt. Das ist eine schlechte Ausgangsbasis für den Mitarbeiter, der ja schließlich etwas von ihm will. Schade, aber so wird er sicher nichts erreichen. Wie macht man es dann besser? In vielen Unternehmen gibt es regelmäßige Mitarbeitergespräche, meistens in jährlichem Abstand. Hier haben Vorgesetzte und Beschäftigte die Möglich- keit, sich über die gegenseitigen Erwartungen auszutauschen, die Arbeit der vergangenen Monate zu rekapitulieren und sich Ge- danken über die gemeinsame Zukunft zu machen. Häufig sind diese Gespräche mit Zielvereinbarungen, in denen festgelegt wird, was der Mitarbeiter erreichen soll, und Boni verknüpft, deren Höhe sich nach der Leistung bemisst (siehe Kapitel Gehältermy- then, »Leistung zahlt sich aus«). Diese Situation ist ideal, um auch die eigenen Vorstellungen, was Entwicklung und Gehalt angeht, zum Thema zu machen. In Unternehmen, in denen es solch regelmäßige Mitarbeiterge- spräche nicht gibt, bleibt nichts anderes übrig, als einen Termin mit dem Vorgesetzten zu vereinbaren. Wenn man dabei den Weg über die Sekretärin gehen muss, sollte man mindestens eine halbe Stunde für sich veranschlagen lassen. Will man vor ihr das Wort »Gehalt« nicht aussprechen, kann man als Termingrund sicher auch seine »Arbeit« angeben. Wenn es üblich ist, dem Chef zu mailen, kann man auf diesem Weg bereits das Gesprächsthema ankündigen: Man möchte über seine Arbeit und Entwicklungs- möglichkeiten mit ihm sprechen.

Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 139 Fehler 5: Drohen Man ist sich sicher, alles richtig gemacht zu haben. Die eigene Leistung stimmt, man fühlt sich sehr gut vorbereitet, man hat den richtigen Zeitpunkt erwischt. Und dann merkt man im Gespräch: Es läuft überhaupt nicht so, wie man es erwartet hat. Man scheint sein Ziel nicht zu erreichen. Was nun? Zunächst: Woran könnte es liegen? Womöglich hat man bei der Vorbereitung den Standpunkt des Chefs außer Acht gelassen (siehe »Fehler 2: Egozentrik«) und falsch eingeschätzt, warum er eine Gehaltsforderung abschlägig bescheiden könnte. Was man nun aber auf keinen Fall machen sollte: mit der Kün- digung zu drohen, ohne wirklich etwas in der Hand zu haben. Womöglich durchschaut der Chef das Spiel. Und dann? Was ist, wenn er einen auflaufen lässt? Dann bleibt wirklich nur die Kün- digung – und die ist riskant, wenn man nicht tatsächlich ein Job- angebot in der Tasche hat. Die andere Möglichkeit, zu bleiben, obwohl man mit der Kündigung gedroht hat, wenn man nicht mehr Gehalt erhält, würde einen Gesichtsverlust bedeuten. Das ist unangenehm genug, noch dazu hat man aber die Möglichkeit verspielt, es später noch einmal mit einer Gehaltsforderung zu versuchen. Mit was will man dann noch drohen? Wenn es wirklich so weit kommt, dass man über die eigenen Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten bei einem anderen Arbeitgeber spre- Tipp: Überlegen Sie, welcher Termin sich für Ihr Gehaltsgespräch anbietet. Überstürzen Sie nichts. Gibt es kein regelmäßiges Mit- arbeitergespräch, bitten Sie Ihren Vorgesetzten um einen Termin.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! chen muss, dann muss man auch ein Angebot haben. (Aber nicht irgendein Angebot, sondern die Zusage für einen Job, den man wirklich annehmen würde. Ansonsten würde es schwerfallen, die Konsequenzen, nämlich die Kündigung, tragen zu müssen.) Dumm wäre es auch, damit zu drohen, die eigene Leistung he- runterzufahren, wenn es nicht mehr Geld gibt. Selbst wenn man dies dann doch nicht tut, wird einen der Chef nach dieser Dro- hung mit anderen Augen sehen, und es wird sehr schwer sein, ihn jemals davon zu überzeugen, dass man mehr Geld wert ist. Man sollte jegliche offene Drohung auf jeden Fall vermeiden. Damit versucht man im Grunde nur, den Vorgesetzten in die Ecke zu treiben. Ohne zu bedenken, dass dies kein Vorgesetzter nötig hat: Er sitzt bei der Gehaltsfrage nun mal am längeren Hebel, so sehr man auch von der eigenen Leistung überzeugt sein mag. Fehler 6: Keine Ahnung von Gehaltsextras Das Ziel einer Gehaltsverhandlung ist für den Mitarbeiter klar: Er möchte einen höheren Verdienst. Dennoch muss er sich darauf einstellen, dass er diese Forderung – aus welchen Gründen auch immer – möglicherweise nicht durchsetzen kann. Was dann? Dann muss er Alternativen parat haben. Es gibt schließlich Gehaltsextras, die ihm zwar nicht monatlich mehr netto auf sein Tipp: Bewahren Sie im Gespräch die Ruhe. Und das selbst, wenn es einen anderen Verlauf nimmt, als Sie erwartet und gehofft haben. Versuchen Sie auf keinen Fall, Ihren Chef in die Ecke zu drängen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! chen Gesprächen. Stellen Sie sich auf die Möglichkeit ein, dass Ihr Chef diesen Vorsprung ausnutzt, sonst laufen Sie Gefahr, über den Tisch gezogen zu werden. Das ist zum Beispiel dann der Fall, wenn der Vorgesetzte dem Mitarbeiter in allem zustimmt. Er ist sehr mit dessen bisheriger Leistung zufrieden, er freut sich über die neuen Ideen und Projekte, die der Mitarbeiter in Angriff nehmen möchte.

Und wenn es notfalls nur die Zusage zu einem weiteren Gespräch ist, in dem man das Thema Gehalt wieder gemeinsam besprechen will.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Und sich selbst fragen: Versteht man auch genau, was er will und wie man das umsetzen kann? Falls nicht, muss man natürlich nachfragen. Man kann auch bereits jetzt um einen weiteren Termin bitten, um nach einiger Zeit wieder gemeinsam darüber zu sprechen, ob man das, was man sich nun vornimmt, auch umsetzen konnte. Wichtig ist es, im Gespräch zu bleiben und den Chef auf seine Seite zu ziehen. So kann aus der – kurzfristig gesehen – erfolg- losen Gehaltsverhandlung langfristig doch noch ein lohnendes Gespräch werden. Fehler 9: Zu hoch pokern Man hat sich informiert, ist sich bezüglich seines eigenen Wertes sicher und hat eine konkrete Zahl im Kopf. Spätestens an der Re- aktion des Gegenübers wird sich zeigen, ob die eigene Vorstel- lung realistisch ist. Wenn er staunt oder gar lachen muss, ist wohl etwas falsch gelaufen. So weit sollte man es aber gar nicht erst kommen lassen. Mag sein, dass man in derselben Position bei einem anderen Unternehmen 10 000 Euro mehr im Jahr verdienen könnte. Aber das heißt noch lange nicht, dass der Vorgesetzte diesen Betrag großzügig drauflegen wird. Er hat eine andere Vergleichszahl: nämlich das bisherige Gehalt.

Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 145 in der Regel nicht gewährt, wenn die Tätigkeit im Großen und Ganzen dieselbe bleibt. Wie viel genau das sein kann, ist schwer zu sagen, weil es doch sehr von der individuellen Position und dem Verhandlungsgeschick abhängt. An ein Plus von 5 Prozent auf das Gesamtgehalt sollte immerhin zu denken sein. (Auf das Monatsnettogehalt gerechnet, macht das nicht wirklich einen großen Unterschied aus. Umso wichtiger ist es, mögliche Alter- nativen parat zu haben, beispielsweise Gehaltsextras.) Schafft man es, den Vorgesetzten davon zu überzeugen, dass man eine höherwertige Position einnehmen kann, kann mich sich auf mehr freuen: Eine Gehaltssteigerung von 10 bis 15 Prozent sollte dann schon möglich sein. Fehler 10: Resignation Bevor man in eine Gehaltsverhandlung geht, sollte man Szenarien entwerfen, wie das Gespräch ablaufen könnte. Man muss sich darüber klar werden, wie man in diesem oder jenem Fall handeln wird, welche Konsequenzen man zu ziehen bereit ist. Vielleicht ist die Gehaltsverhandlung erfolglos. Vielleicht schei- tert man auch bei seinem Vorgesetzten daran, seine Entwicklungs- möglichkeiten zu besprechen. Beides kann dahin führen, dass man sich mit seinem Job unzufrieden fühlt. Der größte Fehler, den man dann machen kann, ist, die Stagnation bei der Tätigkeit und beim Gehalt in Kauf zu nehmen und einfach so weiterzuma- chen wie bisher. Die damit verbundene Aussicht ist traurig: Alles Tipp: Stellen Sie keine überzogenen Forderungen. Gehen Sie nicht mit zu hohen Erwartungen ins Gespräch.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! wird so bleiben, wie es ist. Dabei war man doch dazu bereit, sich noch mehr einzusetzen. In diesem Fall lohnt es sich zu überlegen, ob ein anderer Arbeit- geber nicht mehr Perspektiven bietet. Man kann sich doch zu- mindest einmal informieren und umhören. Ob man, wenn man schließlich ein Jobangebot in der Tasche hat, wirklich wechselt, wird sich dann zeigen. Mancher Arbeitgeber wacht erst dann auf, wenn er befürchten muss, seinen Mitarbeiter zu verlieren. Plötz- lich ist die Gehaltserhöhung dann machbar, plötzlich werden Ent- wicklungsmöglichkeiten aufgezeigt, von denen man bislang nur träumen konnte. Und plötzlich sitzt der Mitarbeiter am längeren Hebel. Er kann jetzt entscheiden, ob er diese verspäteten Angebote annimmt. Für manche Arbeitgeber kommt die späte Einsicht zu spät, sie werden ihren Mitarbeiter, mit dem sie zwar zufrieden waren, den sie aber dennoch zu lange unnötigerweise vor den Kopf gestoßen haben, verlieren. Anderen gelingt es, den Wechselwilligen mit einem kräftigen Gehaltsaufschlag fürs Erste zu halten.

Informieren Sie sich über Alternativen, bewerben Sie sich und haben Sie keine Angst vor Veränderungen. Anderswo braucht und schätzt man genau Ihre Fähigkeiten. Das motiviert. Und bitte, ziehen Sie sich auf keinen Fall frustriert an Ihren Schreibtisch zurück und arbeiten unmotiviert weiter. Damit tun Sie sich keinen Gefallen. ➔\nMehr Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 147 ler nur ins Positive zu drehen und erhält so eine Kurzanleitung, worauf es bei der Gehaltsverhandlung wirklich ankommt: Vorab Regel 1: Sehr gut vorbereiten.

Gehalt: Die Gehalt sverhandlung 149 arbeiter echte Verhandlungsmöglichkeiten, vor allem, wenn ihn sein Arbeitgeber nicht verlieren will.« Akademiker können inzwischen auf einige Quellen zurückgrei- fen, die Absolventengehälter offenlegen. Beispielsweise veröffent- licht die IG Metall jährlich die Einstiegsgehälter in der IT-Industrie für Absolventen der Informatik, der Wirtschafts-, Natur- und der Ingenieurwissenschaften. Die Unternehmensberatung Kienbaum publiziert Einstiegsgehälter branchenunabhängig, und die jährli- che Studie des Personaldienstleiters alma mater schlüsselt die Ge- hälter nach Funktionen auf. Auch die Bundesagentur für Arbeit erläutert in ihren Arbeitsmarktinformationen für Akademiker verschiedener Fachrichtungen die Gehaltssituation. Ansonsten können die allgemeinen Informationsquellen für Gehaltszahlen, auf die sich auch dieses Buch bezieht, aufschlussreich sein, zum Beispiel im Internet die Seite lohnspiegel.de und die Übersicht der Tarifgehälter beim WSI-Tarifarchiv unter tarifspiegel.de. Um sich einen Eindruck zu verschaffen, wie viel von dem vereinbarten Bruttogehalt netto übrig bleibt, ist der Steuerrechner des Bundes- finanzministeriums ideal (www.abgabenrechner.de). Ganz entscheidend zu wissen ist: Alle gemachten Verdienstan- gaben können nur Anhaltspunkte liefern. Im Einzelfall kann das Gehalt von den in den Informationsquellen genannten Beträgen deutlich abweichen – nach unten wie nach oben. Es kommt immer auf das Unternehmen, dessen Größe und Standort, die Branche und die eigene Position an. Dazu kommt, dass die verschiedenen Studien oft unterschied- liche Methoden bei der Auswertung verwenden. Die einen nennen Monatsgehälter, andere ein Jahresgehalt. Einmal werden Gehäl- ter nach Branchen aufgeführt, dann wieder nach Funktionen.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! wirklich wissen will, was verdient wird, muss sich die Studien sehr genau anschauen und möglichst miteinander vergleichen. Jürgen Bühler vom Personaldienstleister alma mater meint dazu: »Oft zitieren Berufseinsteiger Gehälter aus Quellen, die nicht zu- treffend sind: Wenn das durchschnittliche Gehalt für einen Inge- nieur bei Summe X liegt, gilt das nicht für Absolventen. Außerdem wird bei der Interpretation von Gehaltsdaten nicht beachtet, dass es sich dabei um Durchschnittswerte handelt, die sowohl nach unten als auch nach oben abweichen können. Die obere Gehaltsschwelle kann aber nur erreicht werden, wenn der Kandidat optimal auf die ausgeschriebene Stelle passt. Das ist eher selten der Fall!« Es reicht aber nicht, sich nur über die üblichen Gehälter am Markt zu informieren. Schließlich kommt es auch darauf an, wie viel Urlaubstage man hat, ob Überstunden bezahlt werden, ob Weihnachts- und/oder Urlaubsgeld garantiert sind oder stattdes- sen eine Einmalzahlung angeboten wird, die je nach Geschäfts- erfolg und persönlicher Leistung deutlich variieren kann – und in manchen Jahren auch ganz gestrichen werden kann. Am besten ist es, mit jemandem zu sprechen, der schon fest im Berufsleben steht, dem man vertraut und dem man ohne Scheu alle Fragen stellen kann. Auch die Gewerkschaften bieten Beratungen an: Auf der Webseite der DGB-Jugend (www.studentsatwork.org), die sich eigentlich an Praktikanten richten, werden online ent- sprechende Fragen beantwortet. Das alles zeigt: Man braucht Zeit für das Einholen dieser In- formationen und muss bereit sein, diese zu investieren. Gerade Berufseinsteiger neigen dazu, zu naiv an das Thema heranzuge- hen. Sie freuen sich, dass sie einen Job in Aussicht haben, und halten die Formalien für nicht so wichtig – doch das sind sie!

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! gilt dies aber eher bei Stellen für Berufserfahrene. Manche Be- werbungsexperten empfehlen, einen Rahmen anzugeben: »Ich stelle mir ein Gehalt zwischen 30 000 und 35 000 Euro im Jahr vor.« Andere raten davon ab, mit der Begründung, dass sich der Arbeitgeber dann an dem niedrigeren Betrag orientieren wird. Leider gibt es keine allgemeingültige Empfehlung dafür.

Checkliste für die Gehaltsverhandlung Sie haben ein neues Jobangebot und möchten die Gehaltsfrage klären? Sie möchten Ihren Vorgesetzten dazu bringen, Ihnen mehr zu zahlen? Die folgende Checkliste soll Ihnen dabei helfen, sich vorzubereiten. Überprüfen Sie daran auch noch einmal kurz vor der Verhandlung, ob Sie gut vorbereitet sind. 1. Bin ich ausreichend informiert? Weiß ich, wie ich mit meinem Gehalt im Berufs- und Branchenvergleich dastehe? Was verdiene ich, und was sind die möglichen Gehalts- extras? 2. Kenne ich genau meine eigene Gehaltsentwicklung und meine Gehaltsbestandteile? Weiß ich, was die Firma allgemein und mir bereits an Extras gewährt (vermögenswirksame Leistungen, Jobticket etc.)?

im Blick der Wissenschaft »Die Vorstellung, mit immer mehr Geld würden die Lebensqualität und die Zufriedenheit immer mehr steigen, ist eine Illusion.« Utz Claassen, Manager Gehälter sind seit langem Gegenstand der Forschung. Was Wis- senschaftler über die monatliche Bezahlung herausfinden, ist manchmal überraschend, manchmal zum Lachen, aber manchmal auch banal – »Das hätte ich gleich sagen können«, sagt sich dann der Laie. Ein Streifzug durch die Forschungsergebnisse. Hätten Sie das gedacht? Der Neidfaktor Ob ein Beschäftigter mit seiner Bezahlung zufrieden ist, hängt maßgeblich davon ab, wie er Arbeit und Verdienst seines Kollegen einschätzt, wie Wissenschaftler der Universität Bonn in einem Experiment herausgefunden haben. Männliche Versuchspersonen mussten in Zweiergruppen eine ein- fache Aufgabe bewältigen, für die ihnen eine finanzielle Beloh- nung versprochen wurde. Die Probanden lagen nebeneinander in Magnetresonanztomografen und mussten Punkte zählen, die auf einem Bildschirm erschienen, während ihre Gehirnströme gemes- sen wurden. Direkt im Anschluss erfuhren sie, ob ihre Antwort richtig war, wie hoch ihre eigene Belohnung und die ihres Part- ners waren.

im Blick der Wissenschaf t 159 so hoch war wie die des Partners, obwohl dessen Ergebnis eben- falls richtig war. Größe zahlt sich aus Große Männer verdienen mehr als ihre kleineren Kollegen. Ein Unterschied in der Körpergröße von 10 Zentimetern bedeutet 2 000 Euro brutto im Jahr mehr – oder weniger. Der Wirtschaftshistoriker Guido Heineck hat bei Ange- stellten im Alter von 21 bis 50 Jahren Körpergröße und Gehalt verglichen. Datenbasis war das »sozio-ökonomische Panel«, eine Längsschnittstudie in Deutschland, die mehr als 20 000 Personen erfasst und vom Deutschen Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in Berlin erhoben wird. Im Schnitt bringt ein Zentimeter Körper- größe 0,6 Prozent mehr Gehalt. Dieser Zusammenhang ließ sich nur bei Männern in Westdeutschland beobachten. Bei Frauen da- gegen scheint das Gehalt nicht von ihrer Größe abzuhängen. Der Überraschungseffekt Mitarbeiter honorieren es sehr, wenn sie von ihren Vorgesetzten etwas geschenkt bekommen. Damit sich das Geschenk für den Chef auch lohnt und sich seine Be- schäftigten daraufhin mehr für ihn einsetzen, muss er nur eines berücksichtigen: Die Gabe sollte unerwartet kommen. Die beiden Wissenschaftler Charles Bellemare und Bruce S. Shearer von der Universität Laval in Québec führten folgendes Feldexperiment durch: Die Beschäftigten eines Aufforstungs- betriebs wurden generell nur nach der Menge der von ihnen ge- pflanzten Bäume bezahlt und kamen so auf durchschnittlich 200 Dollar täglich. In dem Experiment versprach ihnen ihr Chef vor Beginn der Arbeit einen Bonus von 80 Dollar. Dieses Geschenk kam für die Arbeiter völlig unerwartet.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! wirkte umso stärker nach, je länger die Beschäftigten in der Firma bereits angestellt waren. Für das Institut zur Zukunft der Arbeit in Bonn, bei dem die Studie der beiden Wissenschaftler erschien, ist damit klar: Wer seine Mitarbeiter zu größerer Leistung anspornen möchte, sollte ihnen hin und wieder etwas schenken – und das ganz ohne kon- kreten Anlass. Genug ist genug Die Bedeutung des Gehalts wird überschätzt. Ob ein Mitarbeiter mit seinem Job und den Arbeitsbedingungen zufrieden ist, hängt vor allem von nichtmonetären Faktoren ab. In erster Linie kommt es darauf an, dass sich die Unternehmens- leitung für die Belange der Mitarbeiter interessiert und die Be- schäftigten über ausreichend Entscheidungsfreiräume verfügen. Auch der Ruf des Arbeitgebers sowie gute Lern- und Entwick- lungsmöglichkeiten wirken motivierend. Das ergab eine welt- weite Online-Umfrage der Personalberatung Towers Perrin unter 86 000 Beschäftigten, die in mittleren und größeren Unternehmen verschiedener Branchen arbeiten. In Deutschland wurden mehr als 3 000 Arbeitnehmer befragt. Bei der Entscheidung, ob sie sich langfristig an ein Unternehmen binden, landet eine im Vergleich zu Kollegen als »fair« empfundene Vergütung auf dem dritten Platz. Wichtiger sind auch hier der Ruf des Unternehmens sowie Entscheidungsfreiheiten des Arbeitnehmers. Eine Untersuchung des Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsfor- schung zeigt, dass vor allem Beschäftigte mit hohem Einkommen Grund zur Bescheidenheit haben: Die Lebenszufriedenheit durch mehr Gehalt steigt bei Beschäftigten mit einem niedrigen Aus- gangsgehalt deutlich mehr als bei Gutverdienern. Der subjektive Nutzen, den ein Beschäftigter mit einem Mini-Lohn aus einem zu- sätzlichen Euro bezieht, ist mehr als zehnmal so hoch wie der eines Besserverdieners, der über das Zehnfache an Einkommen

im Blick der Wissenschaf t 161 Verhandlungsscheu Fast die Hälfte der Fach- und Führungs- kräfte in Deutschland hat noch nie mit ihrem Vorgesetzten ihr Gehalt verhandelt. Dieses überraschende Ergebnis erbrachte eine im Februar 2008 veröffentlichte Umfrage der Online-Jobbörse Stepstone, an der in Deutschland 9 711, weltweit 26 682 ihrer Be- nutzer teilnahmen. Demnach führten 43 Prozent der deutschen Befragten noch nie Gehaltsverhandlungen, 38 Prozent dagegen einmal im Jahr, 14 Prozent immerhin alle zwei Jahre. 5 Prozent sprechen sogar mehrmals jährlich mit ihrem Chef über ihr Einkommen. Männer im Vorteil Frauen verhandeln schlechter – zumindest, wenn sie dabei auf sich allein gestellt sind. Das zeigen Studien der Universität Hohenheim. Dort organisiert Wirtschaftsprofes- sor Markus Voeth ein wissenschaftliches Langzeitexperiment. Im Rahmen jährlich stattfindender Verhandlungswettbewerbe unter dem Titel »Battle of the Sexes« erforschen Voeth und seine Mit- arbeiter das Verhandlungsgeschick von Männern und Frauen. Dabei treten die Teilnehmer als Einkäufer und Verkäufer gegen- einander an und versuchen, für ihre Firma das beste Ergebnis herauszuholen. Frauen sind demnach am erfolgreichsten, wenn sie in gut ein- gespielten Teams auftreten. Als Einzelkämpfer schneiden Männer deutlich besser ab. Beim nächsten Wettbewerb wollen die For- scher testen, inwieweit Verhandlungsgeschick angeboren ist und inwieweit es erlernt werden kann.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Untersuchungen und Umfragen über den Zusammenhang zwi- schen Einkommen und Glück der vergangenen Jahre führt sie zu dem Schluss, dass Menschen reicher Gesellschaften subjektiv glücklicher seien als in armen Ländern und auch innerhalb eines Landes sich die Reicheren besser als die weniger Wohlhabenden fühlten. Dabei spielt der Aspekt, mehr als andere zu verdienen, eine kleinere Rolle als die absolute Höhe des Einkommens. Stevenson und Wolfers glauben, damit das sogenannte Easterlin Paradox widerlegt zu haben, das der amerikanische Wirtschafts- wissenschaftler Richard Easterlin bereits in den siebziger Jahren aufgestellt hatte: Demnach sei die relative Höhe des Einkommens entscheidend für die Zufriedenheit. Glück bemesse sich nach Eas- terlin daran, das oder mehr davon zu haben, was in einer Ge- sellschaft als materieller Wohlstand anerkannt ist.

Nur in 37 Prozent der Firmen erhalten die Arbeitnehmer einen vollständigen Lohn- ausgleich. 16,6 Prozent der Arbeitgeber bezahlen die Mehrarbeit immerhin teilweise. Dazu kommen die Überstunden: Jeder Be- schäftigte leistet pro Woche 0,7 Überstunden, die nicht vergütet werden.

im Blick der Wissenschaf t 163 für die gesamte Belegschaft, um so noch mehr Engagement aus ihnen herauszuholen. Solche Mitarbeiter-Rankings sind aber alles andere als motivierend, wie eine Studie des Bonner Instituts zur Zukunft der Arbeit zeigt. Untersucht wurde, wie es sich auf die Mitarbeiter auswirkt, wenn sie die Leistungen ihrer Kollegen kennen. Die Probanden sollten innerhalb einer vorgegebenen Zeit möglichst viele Rechen- aufgaben lösen. Dabei wurden sie laufend über den Punktestand ihrer Kollegen informiert. Die Bezahlung erfolgte in der ersten Variante nach einem Stücklohn für jede richtige Lösung. In der zweiten Variante erhielten das gesamte Geld nur die besten und schnellsten Probanden, während die langsameren leer ausgingen. Wie die Forscher herausfanden, sank die Qualität der Arbeit deutlich, wenn die Teilnehmer ständig über den Punktestand der Mitspieler informiert wurden – und das bei beiden Bezahl- modellen. Vor allem die schwächeren Teilnehmer machten mehr Fehler. Die Wissenschaftler führen das auf höheren Stress und Unsicherheit zurück, allerdings weckte bei manchem Probanden der publik gemachte Punktestand auch den sportlichen Ehrgeiz. Unterm Strich jedoch verringerte sich die Produktivität der ge- samten Gruppe durch die veröffentlichten Rankings. Die Empfehlung der Forscher an die Arbeitgeber ist deutlich: Leistungsrankings eignen sich nicht, um das Engagement und damit die Produktivität der Mitarbeiter zu erhöhen. Vor allem wenn Arbeitgebern auch an den Leistungen der schwächeren Mit- arbeiter liegt, sollten sie von Leistungsrankings Abstand nehmen. Großzügigkeit lohnt sich Auch Wissenschaftler der University of British Columbia haben den Zusammenhang von Geld und Glück untersucht.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! glücklicher als ihre geizigen Zeitgenossen. Für die Studie sollten zwei Gruppen von Probanden Geld ausgeben. Die eine Gruppe sollte nur für sich selbst einkaufen, die zweite Gruppe sollte die Hälfte der Summe für andere investieren. Anschließend wurden die Teilnehmer befragt, wie glücklich sie sich fühlen. Die groß- zügigen Probanden der zweiten Gruppe fühlten sich deutlich zu- friedener. Umsonst arbeitet es sich besser Geld für eine Aufgabe zu be- kommen motiviert nicht zwangsläufig. Es kommt auf die Höhe des finanziellen Anreizes an. Ist diese zu gering, spornt es mehr an, sich unentgeltlich einzusetzen. Das zeigte der Wirtschafts- wissenschaftler Uri Gneezy von der University of California. Im Rahmen seiner Studie sollten Testpersonen, die in drei Gruppen aufgeteilt waren, Aufgaben eines Intelligenztests lösen. Die Teil- nehmer der ersten Gruppe bekamen nichts für ihre Leistung, für die Probanden der zweiten Gruppe gab es eine geringe Entloh- nung und die dritte Gruppe erhielt am meisten Geld. Am faulsten zeigten sich die Teilnehmer, die eine mickrige Entlohnung erhiel- ten. Sogar die unentgeltlich knobelnden Versuchspersonen wiesen eine höhere Leistung auf. Alles für den Traumjob Eine Arbeit, die ihnen wirklich Spaß macht, würden die Deutschen sich einiges kosten lassen: 76 Pro- zent wären bereit, finanzielle Einbußen für ihren Traumjob in Kauf zu nehmen. Für die anderen käme das keinesfalls in Frage, wie eine Umfrage des Jobportals Monster belegt. Im europäischen Vergleich ist den Deutschen das Geld offenbar wichtiger als ihren Kollegen in vielen anderen Ländern: Bei den irischen Arbeitneh- mern würden sogar 84 Prozent Gehaltsabstriche in Kauf nehmen, in Italien 82, in England 81 Prozent.

Wer verdient wie viel? »Ich werde nach meinem Gefühl nie genug Geld haben.« Martin Walser, Schriftsteller Die folgenden Gehaltsangaben geben Durchschnittswerte wieder. Sie wurden von Berufsverbänden, Gewerkschaften und Personal- beratungen erhoben oder entstammen Tarifverträgen. Im Einzel- fall können Gehälter im selben Beruf deutlich voneinander abwei- chen. Kriterien für die genaue Gehaltshöhe sind beispielsweise die eigene Qualifikation und Berufserfahrung, die genaue Position (mit oder ohne Personal- und Budgetverantwortung), aber auch Größe, Branche und Ort des Arbeitgebers und das eigene Ver- handlungsgeschick. Die Gehälter sind brutto angegeben (Nettoeinkommen sind ge- sondert vermerkt), einige spiegeln das Einkommen Selbstständiger wider. In diesem Fall wird der monatliche Bruttogewinn genannt (Bruttojahresgewinn vor Steuern auf den Monat umgerechnet), die Tarifgehälter wurden gerundet. Bei den Monatsgehältern ist zu beachten, dass auf das Jahr gerechnet noch Weihnachtsgeld oder Sonderzahlungen hinzukommen können.\n166 Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt!

Abfindung Wenn ein Arbeitsverhältnis gekündigt wird, wird unter Umstän- den vom Arbeitgeber eine einmalige Geldsumme, die Abfindung, gezahlt. Die Abfindung kann sowohl außergerichtlich vereinbart als auch erst vor Gericht beschlossen werden. Öffentlich kritisiert werden häufig Abfindungen von Managern, vor allem, wenn es sich um Millionenbeträge handelt. Armutsgrenze Die Armutsgrenze liegt nach einer Definition der Europäischen Union bei 60 Prozent des Durchschnittseinkommens. In Deutsch- land sind das für einen Alleinlebenden 781 Euro netto im Monat. Bruttogehalt Das vereinbarte Gehalt ohne Abzug von Steuern und Sozialab- gaben. In Gehaltsverhandlungen werden immer Bruttogehälter vereinbart. Durchschnittseinkommen Das Durchschnittseinkommen zeigt das durchschnittliche Brut- togehalt der deutschen Arbeitnehmer. Laut dem Armuts- und Reichtumsbericht der Bundesregierung sind die Bruttogehälter zwischen 2002 und 2005 um 4,8 Prozent gesunken: von jährlich\n178 Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! 24 873 Euro auf 23 684 Euro. Das hat seinen Grund auch darin, dass Teilzeitbeschäftigung zugenommen hat und immer mehr Be- schäftigte im Niedriglohnsektor arbeiten. Einmalzahlung Unter einer Einmalzahlung versteht man einen Gehaltsbestand- teil, der zusätzlich zu den zwölf Monatsgehältern ausgezahlt wird, daher auch 13. Gehalt genannt. Die Einmalzahlung kann das Weihnachtsgeld sein oder auch vom Betriebsergebnis und/ oder von der persönlichen Leistung abhängen. Einstiegsgehalt Das erste Gehalt, das ein Berufseinsteiger verdient. Elterngeld Diese Form der staatlichen Unterstützung für Familien gibt es seit dem 1. Januar 2007. Das Elterngeld löste das bisherige Bundes- erziehungsgeld ab und soll den Einkommenswegfall auffangen, wenn Mütter und Väter sich für den Nachwuchs eine berufliche Auszeit nehmen. Die Finanzspritze gibt es maximal 14 Monate lang, wenn sich die Elternteile bei der Betreuung abwechseln. Ein Elternteil allein wird höchstens zwölf Monate lang unterstützt. (Eine Ausnahme besteht für Alleinerziehende, für die ebenfalls 14 Monate gelten.) Gezahlt werden mindestens 300, maximal 1 800 Euro. Die Höhe des Elterngelds orientiert sich am bishe- rigen Nettoeinkommen. Geringverdiener und Nichterwerbstätige erhalten den Minimalbetrag von 300 Euro.

Ich verdiene mehr Gehalt! Gewinnbeteiligung Vor allem größere Unternehmen beteiligen ihre Mitarbeiter am Unternehmensgewinn. Laufen die Geschäfte gut, wird den Mit- arbeitern ein Bonus ausgezahlt. Wie das Bonussystem ausgestaltet ist, wird auf Betriebsebene geregelt. Meist sind die Boni für die Mitarbeiter je nach Position unterschiedlich hoch. Heimliche Steuererhöhung (»Kalte Progression«) In Deutschland gibt es einen progressiven Steuertarif: Jeder zu- sätzlich verdiente Euro (beispielsweise durch eine Gehaltserhö- hung) wird mit einem höheren Steuersatz belastet. Wenn der Steuersatz nicht regelmäßig der Inflation angepasst wird, steigen die Steuern »heimlich«, obwohl die Arbeitnehmer real gar nicht mehr verdienen. Investivlohn Investivlohn bedeutet, dass Arbeitnehmern ein Teil ihres Gehalts nicht ausgezahlt wird, sondern sie diesen als Beteiligung an ihrem Unternehmen investieren. Dadurch sollen Arbeitnehmer stärker an Unternehmensgewinnen beteiligt werden. Jahresgehalt Das Jahresgehalt umfasst sämtliche Gehaltsbestandteile: die zwölf Monatsgehälter, möglicherweise Urlaubs- und Weihnachtsgeld sowie eine Einmalzahlung, die abhängig von Betriebsergebnis und persönlicher Leistung sein kann. Leistungsbezahlung Viele Unternehmen haben in den vergangenen Jahren sogenannte variable Gehaltsbestandteile eingeführt.
